Idea is inspired by Hadigaun festival, bhaktapur/thimi festivals, they're really successful!

- Festivals can be held at the ward level in Kathmandu and Lalitpur twice/thrice a year, each lasting one or two days.
- The main issues that we're targeting to fix are are low community engagement, frequent littering, and apathy among young adults toward local politics.
- Each festival will feature:
    - Competitions (dance, singing, art, cooking)
    - Educational workshops on the environment, civic engagement, and skills
    - Performances by local musicians, artists, and cultural groups
    - Booths for local businesses to display products and services
    - Exhibits by community organizations
    - Food stalls with local cuisine
- Expected outcomes:
    - More interaction among residents and a stronger sense of belonging
    - Greater civic participation through discussions and workshops
    - Economic boost for local businesses and the neighborhood
    - Encouragement of responsible waste management, reducing litter
    - Celebration of local culture and traditions
- Funding and sustainability plan:
    - Initial municipal support for equipment and infrastructure
    - Sponsorships from local businesses
    - Voluntary community contributions
    - Revenue from stall fees, ticketed events, and tourism interest
    - Potential grants and NGO partnerships
- Implementation steps:
    - Each ward forms a committee of residents, businesses, and organizations to plan and manage the festival
    - Community volunteers are recruited for logistics and operations
    - Transparent communication and financial reporting are maintained
- Impact will be measured by:
    - Attendance and volunteer participation rates
    - Changes in litter levels and waste collection data
    - Voter registration and turnout statistics
    - Surveys of resident and business satisfaction
- Anticipated challenges and solutions:
    - Funding – use diversified revenue streams and seek grants
    - Venue – use parks, schools, community centers, rotating locations
    - Safety – collaborate with police, plan crowd control, and emergency protocols
    - Waste management – partner with waste companies and set clear disposal signage
    - Community engagement – outreach through media, leaders, and social platforms
    - Volunteer motivation – provide clear roles, training, recognition, and team events
    - Weather and other contingencies – have backup venues or postponement plans

These festivals can revitalize neighborhood spirit, encourage civic involvement, and support local culture and economy.
