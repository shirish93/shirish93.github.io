Starting a chhyang brewkit business in Kathmandu

1. Gotta learn the Tradition  
    • Spend time with local brewers and communities to understand chhyang’s history, cultural role, and brewing process.

2. Create Brewing Kits  
    • Offer kits for beginners and experienced brewers.  
    • Source authentic, locally grown ingredients (e.g., sweet glutinous rice).  
    • Include reusable containers to promote sustainability.
    
3. Provide Clear Instructions  
    • Write simple, step‑by‑step manuals.  
    • Include visual guides or illustrations.  
    • Offer multilingual versions to broaden reach.
    
4. Build a Community  
    • Partner with food bloggers, cultural groups, and local events.  
    • Host workshops, tastings, and competitions to engage participants.  
    • Use social media and forums to share stories and recipes.
    
5. Expand Offerings  
    • Add flavorings such as ginger, herbs, or spices.  
    • Develop online tutorials or courses for deeper learning.  
    • Collaborate with tourism boards to link brewing with cultural tourism.
    
6. Focus Beyond Profit  
    • Preserve and transmit cultural knowledge.  
    • Strengthen community ties.  
    • Promote local ingredients and sustainable practices.
