* have thought about creating an e-cards company in Nepal. 
* got a couple of dozen animated card samples from my friend's sister, who's an animator. 
* needs a lot of marketing, and with ChatGPT and everything else these days, I am afraid the market has been swamped with low-effort losers who wanted to make a high-markup easy business and not put any effort into what their customers want. 
* It's a market of lemons, might not want to go there because it will be eventually carried down
* Should I create a website anyway, to see if anybody bites? Probably need decent SEO/marketing expenses
* Who's my customer? Nepalis? Non-Nepalis who want to get reasonably-priced, high-quality e-cards?
* It might make sense to just upload the ecards I have in-hand anyway, just to 'open-source' things...
