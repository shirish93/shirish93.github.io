Problem

Kathmandu’s air quality, noise level and traffic are worsened by fossil‑fuel public transport.  
Electric three‑wheelers (tuk‑tuks) are a small but growing option that could reduce pollution and improve mobility.

**Why electric tuk‑tuks**

- **Lower emissions** – zero tail‑pipe CO₂ and particulates.
- **Quieter operation** – less noise than gasoline engines or motorcycles.
- **Smaller footprint** – easier to maneuver in narrow streets, reducing congestion.
- **Lower running cost** – electricity cheaper than petrol, potentially lower fares.
- **Local jobs** – manufacturing, maintenance, and charging stations create employment.
- **Energy security** – can be powered by Nepal’s hydropower instead of imported oil.

**Action plan**

|Stage|Actions|
|---|---|
|**Demand creation**|• Subsidise purchase and charging.   <br>• Offer tax breaks for electric vehicles.   <br>• Run public awareness campaigns.|
|**Supply chain**|• Support local production of electric tuk‑tuks.   <br>• Build a network of public charging stations.   <br>• Pilot battery‑swap systems to reduce downtime.|
|**Regulation**|• Simplify permits and licensing for electric vehicles.   <br>• Require driver training on safety and maintenance.   <br>• Set safety standards for chassis, battery and charging infrastructure.|
|**Monitoring**|• Track air‑quality, noise levels, ridership, and economic impact.   <br>• Review program performance regularly and adjust policies.|

**Goal**

Make electric tuk‑tuks a mainstream, clean, and efficient mode of transport in Kathmandu, improving environmental quality and supporting local economic development.
