Problem

Kathmandu’s private schools operate independent bus fleets that cause:

- Heavy traffic congestion from many similar routes
- Redundant routes and under‑used vehicles
- Long commutes that waste time for students and families

Solution:
Create a single, city‑wide school bus system:

1. **Map current routes** with GIS to spot overlaps.
2. **Design a unified network** of efficient routes covering all schools.
3. **Share buses** among schools to cut redundant vehicles.
4. **Sync schedules** so buses run at optimal times.
5. **Place convenient stops** close to students’ homes.
6. **Keep stakeholders informed** through clear communication channels.

Benefits

- Fewer buses = smoother traffic, shorter rides, lower emissions.
- Shared use cuts operating costs and boosts efficiency.
- More free time for learning and family.

Implementation Phases

1. **Pilot** – start with a few schools, test the model, gather feedback.
2. **Expand** – add more schools progressively.
3. **Full roll‑out** – bring all private schools into the system.

Sustainability

- Secure funding via public‑private partnerships or modest user fees.
- Set up a dedicated management team to run operations and resolve disputes.
- Monitor performance regularly and adjust as needed.

Key Tools

- GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS) for mapping.
- Route‑planning software (e.g., BusBoss, Systrans) for optimization.
- GPS trackers on buses for real‑time tracking.
- Communication platforms (SchoolMessenger, Remind) for alerts.

Next Steps

- Conduct a feasibility study.
- Build support among schools, parents, and officials.
- Draft a detailed plan with timelines and budgets.
- Run the pilot, collect data, refine the model.
- Secure ongoing funding and launch the full system.

The goal is to reduce congestion, cut costs, and give students more time to study by consolidating Kathmandu’s fragmented school bus network.
