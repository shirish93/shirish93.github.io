**Proposal: Using Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) for Kathmandu’s Organic Waste**

**Problem**

- Kathmandu produces large amounts of organic waste that are currently landfilled.
- Landfills are reaching capacity, causing environmental pollution and health risks.
- Existing waste management is inefficient and under‑utilises valuable resources.

**Solution**

- Introduce a BSFL system to convert 80 % of organic waste into useful products.
- **Outputs**:
    - _Frass_ – nutrient‑rich fertilizer that can be sold to farmers.
    - _Larvae_ – high‑protein feed for poultry, fish, zoo animals, pets, etc.

**Benefits**

- Cuts landfill waste by 80 %, extending landfill life and saving space.
- Reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution compared with traditional disposal.
- Creates a profitable revenue stream from frass and larvae sales.
- Generates local jobs in rearing, processing, and marketing.
- Improves public health by reducing disease risks from overflowing landfills.

**Pilot Project**

- Start in one Kathmandu district.
- Objectives: prove technical feasibility, gather data on waste reduction, frass quality, larvae yield, and economic returns.
- Build community support and address concerns.

**Implementation Plan**

1. **Site selection** – partner with existing waste facilities or set up a dedicated location.
2. **Set up infrastructure** – acquire breeding stock, equipment, and processing units.
3. **Waste collection** – coordinate with households and businesses to supply organic waste.
4. **Monitoring** – track waste reduction, frass quality, larvae output, and costs.
5. **Evaluation** – refine processes based on data before scaling.

**Scalability**

- After a successful pilot, roll out the system across Kathmandu in phases.
- Form partnerships with waste‑management companies, farmer cooperatives, and animal‑feed producers to secure markets and share resources.

**Regulatory Support**

- Work with local authorities to establish necessary regulations and approvals for BSFL operations and product sales.

**Need**

- Request approval from the Council of Ministers to launch the pilot.
- Emphasise the project’s alignment with waste‑management goals, environmental protection, and economic development.

**Next Steps**

- Conduct a detailed cost‑benefit analysis.
- Identify potential partners and investors.
- Develop a timeline, budget, and responsibilities for each phase.
- Address social impacts, such as job displacement and odor control, through community outreach.
