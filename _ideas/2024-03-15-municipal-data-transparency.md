1. Goal  

    Create a non‑profit that automates collection of local‑government data in Nepal, measures its availability and quality, and publishes performance reports.
    
2. Problem
    
    - Data required by law is often inaccessible (images, non‑standard formats).
    - Updates are delayed or missing.
    - “Freedom of Information” requests are ignored.  
        Result: Citizens lack reliable information for participation and oversight.
    
2. Solution
    
    - Build an automated platform that scrapes or pulls data from municipal websites.
    - Define metrics for availability, timeliness, standard format, and FOI responsiveness.
    - Publish regular reports ranking municipalities.
    - Reward high performers; offer support to low performers.

3. Methodology
    
    - Phase 1 (Pilot): Test on a few municipalities and data sets.
    - Phase 2 (Scale): Expand coverage to all municipalities and more data categories.
    - Use existing APIs where possible; partner with government bodies, NGOs, and media for reach and expertise.

4. Impact
    
    - Citizens gain timely, trustworthy data.
    - Municipalities face accountability, prompting better service delivery.
    - Trust and engagement in local governance increase.

5. Sustainability
    
    - Funding from international grants, crowdfunding, private partnerships, and fees for capacity‑building workshops.
    
6. Implementation Plan
    
    1. Engage stakeholders and assess needs.
    2. Build the data‑collection platform.
    3. Define and weight accountability metrics.
    4. Pilot, refine, and gather feedback.
    5. Launch publicly and provide capacity building.
    6. Publish reports, recognize best performers, and partner with media.
    7. Secure ongoing funding, add data categories, and expand nationwide.
