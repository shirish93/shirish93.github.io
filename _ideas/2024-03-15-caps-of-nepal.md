**Caps of Nepal – Business Summary**

- **Idea**  
    Offer curated collections of high‑quality, handcrafted traditional caps from across Nepal. Each set showcases multiple ethnic styles and comes with explanatory packaging that explains history, cultural significance, and origin.
    
- **Opportunity**  
    Tourists and culturally‑aware buyers often cannot find authentic, varied Nepali souvenirs; existing options are generic or limited to single items.
    
- **Target customers**
    
    1. Luxury travelers who want unique, premium keepsakes.
    2. People interested in Nepali culture, looking for meaningful gifts or personal items.
- **Value proposition**  
    • Diverse, representative selection of caps in one set.  
    • Premium, ethically sourced materials and fair‑trade production.  
    • Informative packaging that turns a souvenir into a learning experience.  
    • Tiered pricing: premium 12‑cap set (~~$120) and affordable 5‑cap set (~~$40).
    
- **Competitive gap**  
    Nepal sells many individual caps, but none offer a ready‑made, curated luxury collection with contextual information.
    
- **Implementation plan**
