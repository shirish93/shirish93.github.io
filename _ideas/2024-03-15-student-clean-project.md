**Main Issue**

- 1600 tons of waste are generated each day in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, but only about 70 % reach proper disposal facilities.
- Litter is common, especially in residential areas, causing clogged drains, stagnant water, and breeding sites for disease‑carrying insects.
- Cleanliness is valued at home, but collective responsibility for public spaces is weak, partly because many residents move in from elsewhere.

**Proposed Solution – Two‑Pronged Approach**

1. **Student‑Led Monitoring and Competition**
    
    - Schools are chosen to run a year‑long competition focused on keeping their assigned neighborhood clean.
    - Teachers and community leaders train students in waste‑management practices, communication, and leadership.
    - Each school monitors a specific area daily, records litter levels, and tracks progress.
    - Scores are based on cleanliness, community involvement, and educational activities; the highest‑scoring school wins.

2. **Incentivized Waste Separation**
    
    - Residents receive separate bins for compostable and non‑compostable waste.
    - Trained collectors gather the separated streams.
    - Households that consistently separate waste earn tokens that can be exchanged for small gifts or discounts at local businesses.

**Community Collaboration**

- Local businesses take responsibility for cleaning their surroundings and encouraging proper disposal among customers.
- Regular clean‑up drives and awareness campaigns involve residents, students, and organizations.
- Open communication channels are set up to address concerns and gather feedback.

**Sustainability Plan**

- Core activities are integrated into the school curriculum to maintain momentum after the competition ends.
- Partnerships with NGOs and government agencies secure funding and allow expansion to other neighborhoods.
- Results are tracked and reported transparently to demonstrate impact.

**Evaluation Metrics**

- Daily monitoring of litter levels and waste composition.
- Surveys measuring residents’ perceptions of cleanliness and participation in waste separation.
- Counts of schools, students, and community members involved in activities.
- Analysis of health indicators such as respiratory and water‑borne illnesses.


Local governments, businesses, and community members cano join the initiative to improve public hygiene, protect health, and enhance the city’s quality of life.
