**Project to Reduce Littering in Nepal’s National Parks**  
(Shivapuri, Nagarjun, and other parks)

---

## 1. Background

- Litter in national parks harms wildlife, degrades visitor experience, and creates costly cleanup work.
- Existing measures are inadequate; new, low‑cost, evidence‑based interventions are needed.
- The project draws on behavioral science, financial incentives, and community engagement, all proven effective in other contexts.

## 2. Core Ideas

1. **Pre‑filled trash baskets at park entrances** – a visual cue that “cleaning up” is the norm.
2. **Deposit‑based reusable trash containers** – visitors receive a container with a refundable deposit; the deposit is returned only when the container is returned.
3. **Youth‑led clean‑up drives** – schools and colleges organize regular clean‑ups to build stewardship and local ownership.

## 3. Detailed Interventions

### 3.1 Pre‑filled Trash Baskets

- Large, clearly visible baskets at entry gates, filled with a small amount of litter to signal social proof.
- Rangers point them out and remind visitors that others have already used them.
- Estimated set‑up cost: **Rs. 20,000** for the first batch.

### 3.2 Deposit‑based Trash Containers

- Visitors receive a reusable container (e.g., recycled plastic or metal) with a **Rs. 100** deposit.
- Containers are collected at exit points; deposit is refunded if the container is returned in good condition.
- Unreturned containers forfeit the deposit, creating a deterrent.
- Initial cost depends on material choice; a cost‑benefit analysis will be done before purchase.

### 3.3 Youth Clean‑up Initiatives

- Collaborate with schools and colleges to schedule regular park clean‑ups.
- Offer certificates and awards for participation rather than cash payments.
- Minimal costs: supplies (gloves, bags) and recognition materials.

## 4. Measurement of Success

|Metric|How It’s Measured|
|---|---|
|Litter volume|Weighing trash collected at entry/exit points; ranger logs|
|Deposit return rate|Number of containers returned vs. issued|
|Visitor feedback|Short surveys or comment cards|
|Ranger observations|Routine patrol reports|
|Community engagement|Attendance at clean‑up events|

---

## 5. Implementation Timeline

|Phase|Timing|Key Activities|
|---|---|---|
|Approval & funding|Month 1–2|Secure budget, procure materials|
|Staff training|Month 3–4|Rangers learn communication strategies|
|Pilot launch|Month 5–6|Install baskets, distribute containers, start youth drives|
|Evaluation|Month 7|Review data, adjust program|
|Scale‑up|Post‑Month 7|Expand to all national parks if targets met|

## 6. Supporting Evidence

- **Deposit systems** – e.g., [Aldi cart deposit](https://lakevoicenews.org/quarter-for-a-cart-the-real-reason-you-need-a-quarter-for-your-shopping-cart-at-aldi-80fbe9233809?gi=92f2865967f4) shows effective behavior change.
- **Reusable bag programs** – e.g., [Rocky Mountain National Park WAG bag](https://www.backpacker.com/trips/packing-out-waste-you-can-take-it-with-you/) reduced litter by holding visitors accountable.
- **Social proof nudges** – research demonstrates that pre‑filled bins can shift norms in public spaces.

## 7. Sustainability & Long‑Term Impact

- **Community ownership** keeps the program alive beyond initial funding.
- **Local businesses** can provide reusable containers, creating a small local economy around sustainability.
- **Revenue from unclaimed deposits** can be reinvested in park maintenance.

## 8. Conclusion

The proposed three‑part strategy—visual nudges, financial incentives, and youth engagement—is low‑cost, evidence‑based, and scalable. By aligning visitor behaviour with environmental stewardship, Nepal’s national parks can become cleaner, safer, and more attractive destinations, while also fostering a culture of conservation among the next generation. The project invites the National Parks Department to partner and pilot this approach for immediate and lasting benefit.
