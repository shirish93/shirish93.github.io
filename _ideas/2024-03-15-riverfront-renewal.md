- **Current Problems**  
    • Rivers are polluted with untreated sewage, industrial waste and plastic.  
    • Infrastructure is weak – no sanitation, poor drainage, eroding banks.  
    • Residents feel disconnected from the rivers, missing a valuable public space.
    
- **Goals**  
    • Clean water and safe recreational areas.  
    • Economic opportunities for locals (markets, restaurants, tourism).  
    • Improved quality of life and stronger community pride.
    
- **Core Strategies**
    
    1. **Community‑driven planning** – workshops and consultations so residents shape the projects.
    2. **Economic incentives** – partner with businesses to create eco‑tourism, markets and waste‑management ventures that generate jobs.
    3. **Skill building** – train locals in sustainable practices, waste handling and maintenance.
    4. **Public‑private partnerships** – bring together government, NGOs and businesses to share resources and expertise.
- **Pollution Control Measures**  
    • Incentives for waste segregation and recycling (tax breaks, subsidies).  
    • Public awareness campaigns and regular clean‑up drives.  
    • Low‑cost wastewater treatment options such as constructed wetlands or biodigesters.
    
- **Implementation Timeline (5 years)**  
    _Year 1_: Needs assessment, stakeholder engagement, action plan.  
    _Years 2‑3_: Install sanitation, build waste‑management infrastructure, pilot green spaces.  
    _Year 4_: Expand green areas, launch tourism and local business projects.  
    _Year 5_: Impact assessment, refine actions, cement community ownership.
    
- **Learning from Successful Models**  
    – Combine historic charm with modern amenities.  
    – Offer a mix of dining options to appeal to all budgets.  
    – Create lively nighttime scenes with music and entertainment.  
    – Design for pedestrian access to encourage walking and interaction.
    
- **Outcome**  
    Rejuvenated rivers will become clean, vibrant hubs that support the environment, boost the local economy, and strengthen cultural identity for Kathmandu and Lalitpur.
