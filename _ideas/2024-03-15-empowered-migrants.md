Summary of the Low‑Skilled Nepali Migrant Upskilling Program

1. Problem Statement  
    • Over 500,000 Nepalis travel abroad each year for low‑wage jobs in construction, agriculture, and service sectors.  
    • Workers face limited mobility, low wages, and high risk of exploitation.  
    • Existing training schemes do not reach this group because they lack relevance, affordability, and accessibility.
    
2. Program Goal  
    • Equip low‑skilled migrant workers with market‑relevant skills so they can secure better‑paying, skilled positions overseas and improve their overall well‑being.
    
3. Core Components
    - Pre‑departure Training (30 days)  
        • Sector‑specific technical modules (e.g., masonry, carpentry, window cleaning, hospitality).  
        • Practical workshops, classroom lessons, and basic language instruction.
    - Vacation Upskilling  
        • Short courses offered during workers’ holidays in Nepal to refresh or add new skills as market demands change.
        
4. Partnership Network  
    • Manpower companies – identify job needs and help place trained workers.  
    • NGOs – provide expertise in skills development and worker outreach.  
    • Government technical schools (CTEVT) – supply facilities and qualified instructors.  
    • International development agencies – offer funding and technical support.
    
5. Success Metrics  
    • 20 % rise in average monthly wages within six months after training.  
    • Higher placement rates in skilled jobs with reputable employers.  
    • Improved worker satisfaction and reduced vulnerability to exploitation.  
    • Long‑term benefits for families through increased remittances and overall quality of life.
    
6. Strategic Benefits  
    • Strengthens Nepal’s position as a source of skilled labor rather than just low‑wage workers.  
    • Creates a sustainable model that can be replicated for other skill areas.  
    • Enhances national economic development by raising incomes and improving human capital.
    
7. Implementation Notes  
    • Training centers should be located at accessible sites (e.g., Mahabir Pun’s Krishi Aujar karkhana).  
    • Continuous monitoring and evaluation will track outcomes and guide program adjustments.  
    • Ethical safeguards must be in place to prevent post‑training exploitation.
    

This program offers a practical, collaborative framework to raise the earning potential and dignity of Nepal’s migrant workforce while delivering measurable economic and social returns.
