**Digital Fabrication of Nepali Woodcarving**

**Purpose**  
Use 3D scanning, printing, and CNC machining to preserve, reproduce, and broaden access to traditional Nepali woodcarvings.

**Key Problems**

- Hand‑crafted carvings are costly and slow to produce.
- Demand for intricate designs outstrips available artisans and wood supplies.
- Limited use of wood threatens long‑term sustainability.

**Proposed Solution**

1. Scan existing carvings from temples and museums with high‑resolution 3D scanners.
2. Create digital models that capture fine detail.
3. Produce replicas:
    - 3D‑printed lightweight, weather‑resistant pieces for homes and public spaces.
    - CNC‑milled wooden or plastic carvings that maintain a traditional look at lower cost.
4. Offer custom designs based on traditional patterns or client specifications.

**Impact**

- **Preservation** – digital archives keep designs safe for future generations.
- **Accessibility** – affordable replicas let more people enjoy the art.
- **Sustainability** – less wood consumption; durable materials for outdoor use.
- **Economic gain** – jobs in printing, finishing, and design; new market for cultural goods.
- **Education & tourism** – workshops and exhibits can be built around the digital models.

**Implementation Plan**

| Phase | Focus                                                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Pilot scan a selection of carvings at a chosen temple.                             |
| 2     | Refine digital models; partner with 3D‑printing firms and local artisans.          |
| 3     | Market replicas through local vendors, online stores, and tourism channels.        |
| 4     | Expand scanning to additional temples and museums; incorporate community feedback. |

**Financing & Sustainability**

- Cost analysis will cover scanning equipment, printing materials, labor, and marketing.
- Revenue from product sales will support operations.
- Potential supplemental funding from government grants or private partnerships.
