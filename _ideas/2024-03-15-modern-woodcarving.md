Digital Fabrication of Nepali Woodcarving, Pottery and other traditional products


** This updated written on Nov 5, 2025 **
* I would definitely be willing to find a bunch of engineering-related projects like the tundal creation or laser cutting projects, etc. 
* Sell molds, pottery, or create molds for pottery. Idea: Use 3d printing to create cement molds!
* How do they create cement mold for flowerpots etc? Because the flowerpots are quite expensive!
* Is there any a market for people to buy those molds? 
* There are a lot of pottery businesses in Nepal, and people pay a really good sum of money for those. 
* That could be made cost-effective. 
* Pottery by Ken is a YouTube channel that I could use
* Make molds for pottery using 3D prints based on Pottery by Ken YouTube channel. 
* how much do they pay for those molds?
	* Couple of thousand for each mold? Could make a couple of molds every day?
	* The design part would probably be the most challenging part...
	* How fast could we iterate on new designs? How fast could we sell them?

Purpose  

Use 3D scanning, printing, and CNC machining to preserve, reproduce, and broaden access to traditional Nepali woodcarvings.

Key Problems

- Hand‑crafted carvings are costly and slow to produce.
- Demand for intricate designs outstrips available artisans and wood supplies.
- Limited use of wood threatens long‑term sustainability.

Proposed Solution

1. Scan existing carvings from temples and museums with high‑resolution 3D scanners.
2. Create digital models that capture fine detail.
3. Produce replicas:
    - 3D‑printed lightweight, weather‑resistant pieces for homes and public spaces.
    - CNC‑milled wooden or plastic carvings that maintain a traditional look at lower cost.
4. Offer custom designs based on traditional patterns or client specifications.

Impact

- Preservation – digital archives keep designs safe for future generations.
- Accessibility – affordable replicas let more people enjoy the art.
- Sustainability – less wood consumption; durable materials for outdoor use.
- Economic gain – jobs in printing, finishing, and design; new market for cultural goods.
- Education & tourism – workshops and exhibits can be built around the digital models.

Implementation Plan

| Phase | Focus                                                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Pilot scan a selection of carvings at a chosen temple.                             |
| 2     | Refine digital models; partner with 3D‑printing firms and local artisans.          |
| 3     | Market replicas through local vendors, online stores, and tourism channels.        |
| 4     | Expand scanning to additional temples and museums; incorporate community feedback. |

Financing & Sustainability

- Cost analysis will cover scanning equipment, printing materials, labor, and marketing.
- Revenue from product sales will support operations.
- Potential supplemental funding from government grants or private partnerships.
