- **Problem** – Many remote villages have empty homes because residents leave for jobs elsewhere. The villages lose income, culture, and a sense of community.
    
- **Idea** – Restore the abandoned houses, equip them with basic services (water, electricity, simple furnishings) and let long‑term tourists stay in them. The guests will stay weeks to months, paying a modest rent.
    
- **Why it matters** –
    
    - Creates jobs for villagers in construction, maintenance and guest service.
    - Keeps money in the local economy.
    - Gives tourists an authentic rural experience – no over‑tourism, no mass‑tourist crowds.
    - Encourages preservation of traditional building techniques and local crafts.
    - Offers a model that can be copied in other villages.
- **First pilot village** – Bhedpu in Dolakha district. It has many abandoned houses and a road link, making it a good test case.
    
- **Key actions**
    
    1. **Survey and classification** – List houses by size, condition and location.
    2. **Renovation** – Use local materials and artisans. Provide basic amenities; higher‑end rooms can have private bathrooms and better insulation.
    3. **Staffing** – Train villagers in housekeeping, basic maintenance and guest communication. Keep services low‑key so guests have privacy but can call for help.
    4. **Marketing** – Target remote workers, budget travelers and families through online communities, travel blogs and social media. Emphasise privacy, freedom and cultural immersion.
    5. **Guest support** – Provide a 24/7 hotline for emergencies and a simple guide on local attractions and activities.
    6. **Sustainability** – Install water‑saving fixtures, use solar or local energy sources where possible, and set up a small waste‑recycling system.
    7. **Community benefits** – Share a portion of profits with homeowners, support local shops and help improve basic infrastructure (roads, communication, waste).
- **Social and environmental impact** – Job creation, income diversification, preservation of heritage buildings, reduced environmental footprint through local sourcing and energy efficiency.
    
- **Financial outline** –
    - Up‑front costs: renovation, utilities, marketing.
    - Recurring costs: staff wages, maintenance, utilities.
    - Revenue: monthly stays, optional extra services (meals, laundry).
    - Expected return: modest profit after 2–3 years, with profits shared with villagers.
- **Next steps** – Prepare a detailed budget, obtain the necessary permits, secure initial funding, and begin renovations in Bhedpu. Once successful, scale to other villages with similar conditions.
