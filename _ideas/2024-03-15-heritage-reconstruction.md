**Overview**

A proposal to preserve traditional houses in Kathmandu and Lalitpur by rebuilding them, adding new floors, and leasing the added space to investors. Rental income is shared with homeowners, creating financial benefits for residents while safeguarding heritage.

### 1. Challenge

- Many historic houses are aging, damaged by earthquakes and weather, and lack resources for repair.
- Deterioration threatens cultural heritage and poses safety risks for occupants.

### 2. Proposed Solution

- **Reconstruction** of each house following strict heritage‑conservation standards.
- **Vertical expansion**: add one or more floors to increase usable area by 50–100 %.
- **Leasing** the added floors to investors seeking attractive returns in a prime cultural location.
- **Revenue sharing**: rental income split between homeowners and investors.

### 3. Target Audience

- **Primary**: Kathmandu and Lalitpur municipal governments (urban development departments).
- **Secondary**: construction firms, real‑estate investors, heritage‑preservation NGOs, cultural‑tourism businesses.

### 4. Benefits

|Stakeholder|What they gain|
|---|---|
|Homeowners|Modern amenities, safer homes, larger living space, regular rental income|
|Investors|Market‑beating returns in a culturally significant area, long‑term leasehold|
|Community|Revitalised heritage, improved streetscape, increased tourism, job creation|
|Government|Higher living standards, heritage conservation, boosted tourism revenue|

### 5. Addressing Concerns

- **Conservation integrity**: Work with architects and engineers experienced in heritage projects.
- **Community buy‑in**: Open public forums, transparent communication, responsive to individual concerns.
- **Long‑term sustainability**: Pilot program, scaling to additional houses, attracting tourism‑related investors, dedicated project‑management team.

### 6. What to do next

Invite municipal governments, local businesses, investors, and community members to partner in this program. Collaboration will preserve Kathmandu and Lalitpur’s cultural heart and generate shared prosperity.

### 7. Next Steps

1. Conduct a detailed feasibility study with financial projections.
2. Launch a pilot with 10–30 houses to demonstrate effectiveness.
3. Form a dedicated project‑management team.
4. Market the opportunity to potential investors and homeowners.

Executing these steps will breathe new life into the city’s heritage houses and secure them for future generations.
