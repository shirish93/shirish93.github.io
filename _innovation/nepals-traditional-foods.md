* COPY THE DOCUMENT AND SEE WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE.
* OKAY to be 2000 words, okay to put most material right on this page, don't need a whole another document.
* won't take too long since I've already written most of it!
* Talk about level of commitment necessary, and what the engagement process would be like? What should somebody do if they're interested?
What is the idea exactly?
Why do I support it so strongly, why is it a keystone idea, a hobby horse for me?
Would I be willing to fund it? What's next? Where do I want to take the plan next?
What would be the MLP (minimally lovable product) or MVP(minimally viable product) for it?
