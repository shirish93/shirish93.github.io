## REMEMBER TO CREATE A ROOT INNOVATION PAGE SUMMARIZING THESE, AND ALSO BRINGING UP OTHER THINGS HAVE DONE!


## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE ideas BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, it's not even a draft yet! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE
Give an overview of my involvement, the circumstancs arount it, What was the outcome, what were the learnings, what were the recommendations?
The following documents will take a couple of pages on their own, and the presentations too, so there needs to be an introduction page to summarize what this is all about. mention mentorship, mahabir pun dai, agricultural tools factory travel, and other recommendations (in recommendations bring up variability in the stages of different startups creating disjointed experience, engineering-led development causing business viability issues, the competition between product development and service provision creating delays etcetera)

## Terms of engagement

# National Innovation Center and Shirish Pokharel (Innovation Consultant)
## Defining the parameters of joint engagement

**Shirish Pokharel**  

### Summary
The following is a high-level document describing the parameters of engagement between Shirish Pokharel, and the National Innovation Center. The goal of the document is to clarify expectations and parameters for the engagement, so it is easier to manage accountability, create transparency of ongoing work, establish timelines, measure outcomes, and evaluate opportunities for improvements.

### Goal
[Shirish’s goal at NIC is] To build capacity at NIC in various verticals (as described in this document) where there’s opportunity for growth until there’s no need for further capacity building, by directly interacting with the innovators at NIC and the various projects there. In the meanwhile, take responsibility for those verticals personally, train interns to perform the required tasks, and make a case to management to engage full-time innovators to take over those responsibilities.

### Timeline
- While I’m in Nepal (until mid-May) on a generally twice-weekly visit, then for six additional months while the Center builds manpower and financial resources to fully take-on those tasks. 
- 4-hour weekly commitment in mentoring, product development, and relationship management for the additional six months. 
- Exploration of further collaboration beyond the timeframe if there’s interest from both parties.

### Responsibilities
**Current**
- Mentor Lead Engineers and assist them in taking management responsibilities
- Train and mentor interns, possibly full-time innovators for Product Owner role
- Train and mentor interns, possibly full-time innovators for Relationship Manager role
- Initial working as Product Owner for the top-4 prioritized projects until full-timers join
- Assist existing projects towards their business development goals
- Business trainings for engineers

**Additional proposed**
- Take leadership of the BSFL program, with the role of the promoter, and Business Development Manager, and generate market for the project.
- Partner relationship management: maintain and explore opportunities with national and international research institutions, hospitals, private companies, non-profit agencies, I/NGO’s, government agencies, etc.
- Make case for, and organize the first of (eventually regular) “NIC Open Day” event
- Engage resources to 1) propose an interior redesign of the NIC 2) convince stakeholders of the value of the redesign (or any redesign) 3) find funding for the proposed redesign and, 4) create structures that will eventually execute the redesign

### Requirements from NIC
**Current**
- Help with hiring interns!
- Acknowledgement of the need for collaboration and my assistance
- Need the initial buy-in from a large portion of the engineers and technicians towards what I’m doing, and an acknowledgement that the sort of assistance I’m providing is needed assistance …either through me, or from a more full-time dedicated resource
- Need NIC to make relevant connections to accomplish the tasks described in “Responsibilities” as required

**Additional proposed**
- If there is a need to represent NIC to external parties (for BSFL work, partnership management) etc, these are to further requirements:
    - Need a place on the website too, clearly explaining what I’m doing at the Center, with my photo!
    - Also need an email address from NIC for official NIC business!

### Other opportunities to explore
- Design and implement a system with clear expectations, vision, goals, timeline and evaluation for online/hybrid volunteers. Setup proper guidelines and structure to enforce accountability and transparency. Include synchronous requirement for remote volunteers in different time zones
- Identify what work can be done towards improving the gender ratio situation at the Center
- Identify and define a clear process for new project intake for the Center, if there isn't one already
- Explore opportunities and provide mentorship for conference and tradeshow participation for engineers and Innovators
- Professional mentorship for engineers, who does that, somebody needs to, it's important for improving innovator retention
- Team building for the entire Center, what can be done there?
- Clearly understand and document which part of the design, prototyping, manufacturing, and sales steps NIC intends to focus on, if any
- Product designers: set up long term goals, desires and ways to achieve those. Evaluate the center's need for them
- Lobby the Center to hire at least three full-time roles: Engineering Manager (team building, mentorship, technical guidance, negotiations and management work), Product Manager (for doing product Owner work for  all the products), and Business Development Manager (business development work). Marketing might be done by interns (?) and product design by partnering with external orgs?
