## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE ideas BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, it's not even a draft yet! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE


* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tfZdUGRLKwc-TVzJkzoOOuH6BEuo6C2pDKkhI1M14_Q/edit
* Use brainstorming tools to expand out on this idea more explicitly...
* Put local angle front and center.
* WHAT EXACTLY NEEDS TO BE DONE? Is it Marketing? Is it consolidation? Is it creating an organization? Is it creating an email group?
* Do we have a timeline of execution? What could be done?
What is the idea exactly?
Why do I support it so strongly, why is it a keystone idea, a hobby horse for me?
Would I be willing to fund it? What's next? Where do I want to take the plan next?
What would be the MLP (minimally lovable product) or MVP(minimally viable product) for it?
