**Announcement.** Most of the illustrations in this website were generated by Google's Gemini AI. It was done when I didn't know any better. I will eventually be replacing them with my own hand-drawn art.

 I enjoy the art and craft of illustrating, shit as I may be at it. Art and the act of creation has intrinsic value in itself. To use art as a throwaway 'artifact' that can trivially be 'generated' is to undermine it. Then there's this argument around the ethics of training and consent...which...let's not go there.

I work on the genAI team for my company. I have been allowed to do the most cutting-edge work any engineer can ask for. I see the value, and I see the limits. This is where I draw the line. I care about this website enough that I'll bother putting effort into it.

Learning poetry has its merits, quaint as the value may be now. Skills that engage our tactile senses and observational depth are particularly more valuable. We've become a culture of fingers-and-eyes.  Surrendering the active use of engaging sensory-rich creative activities and replace with passive consumption isn't on the cards for the year.
