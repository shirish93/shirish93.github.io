Seriously, don't publish that raw ChatGPT'd thinkfluencer piece as your own. Nobody's falling for it, everybody's doing it, and you're cheating yourself.

It is mid-December of 2024 and I'm in Nepal. I've been spending the past few weeks in the temperate Sun of Kathmandu's winter. Few days ago I got tea with a friend at Le Sherpa cafe, possibly one of the more expensive Nepali restaurants I went to. We got to talking about how important writing and communicating your experiences to potential employers is.

I told him the story of this blog. I'd been writing for 6 months-- without publishing -- when I discovered chatGPT[^1]. It wrote everything better than I did! So I fed it my essays, hoping it'd edit them and make them sound more professional. I posted the lightly-edited output on this blog. It took me a few weeks to post the articles. It's taken me a year (and ongoing) to edit out that slop, and get my voice back.

[^1]: I'm using chatGPT as a general term for all AI/LLM systems. 

My friend was nodding vigorously. He had a similar experience. He takes time to write detailed analysis pieces on his industry, and posts them on LinkedIn. But that takes lots of time to research, write, and organize. When he has a general idea and not a detailed concept, he runs it through chatGPT, creates an outline, and posts it.


"I can tell the difference between the pieces I've put more effort into, and the other pieces," he said. He discovered that quite a few people on his LinkedIn feed were actually posting similarly half-assed chatGPT-gen'd pieces! And some read quite close to those he had generated! "That was it. It was the signal that anybody posting ai slop is only hurting themselves," he told me.

It's clear now that posting such pieces only reflects poorly on the poster, and bring them absolutely no respect. If anybody can do it in fifteen seconds with zero effort, it doesn't showcase critical thinking or knowledge. It's a clear sign of laziness, a lack of effort, and unawareness of the expectations these days.

But more importantly, doing so hurts us more much deeper in a different way.

By putting our names on pieces which -- lets be honest here -- we had very little 'hand' in creating, we're taking away our creativity. We're losing our voice, our perspective, our writing skills, and handing it over to the AI system. We're not growing. Not as writers, neither as editors, and definitely not as thinkers. The choice we're making is not one of 'saying something', it's 'agreeing or disagreeing' with something that's been said by somebody else. Instead of copy-pasting the essays from chatGPT, we might as well post a link to the ai-generated webpage, with a comment below that says "I agree." If we're going to outsource the thinking, and learning to computers, what does remain?

Another midday tea meeting, on a Kathmandu Java coffee rooftop, a week before Christmas. A friend related the experience of a close relative of his. The job they were in was unsatisfying, and involved writing lots of reports. The reports wouldn't be read by (m)any, but it involved collating data, and proposing course of action. It was the only stimulating part of the job. After the arrival of chatGPT, they automated most of the report-creation part using it. And now the only intellectually rewarding part of the job was gone. They were merely the person who copied from chatGPT, created a pdf, and emailed it. A very well-paid job, but they were on the verge of quitting.

Thing is, chatGPT is at the very best, mediocre at thinking and expressing. We're impressed because we've seen the jump from random babble to potentially with insight. Our grandparents gorged on post-war diet of fats and sugars because it was so abundant. Might we be doing the same for information, and now, thinking? It adds bulk, but does it nurture, does it help us grow?
