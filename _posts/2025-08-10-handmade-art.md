Announcement Post. Most of the illustrations in this website were generated by Google's Gemini AI. It was done when I didn't know any better. I will eventually be replacing them with my own hand-drawn art.

 I enjoy the art and craft of illustrating, shit as I may be at it. People's art and the act of creation has intrinsic value in itself. To use art as a throwaway 'artifact' that can trivially be 'generated' is to undermine it. Then there's this argument around the ethics of training and consent...which...let's not go there.

I work on the genAI team for my company. I have been allowed to do the most cutting-edge work any engineer can ask for. I see the value, and I see the limits. This is where I draw the line. I care about this website enough that I'll bother putting effort into it.
