Surprising lessons on how watching Age of Empires IV videogame online teaches important lessons applicable for software engineers.

### Introduction 

The worlds of competitive e-sports and software/infrastructure engineering might seem like disparate universes at first glance. I, however, have learned valuable lessons from watching Age of Empired IV (AOE4) that I've been able to leverage into useful skills at work. This essay will explore how the skills honed through watching AOE4 esports have made me a better engineer, focusing on areas such as handling pressure, strategic planning, resource management, and adapting to change.

I have been watching the game ever since it released, following a few game 'casters', but mostly the players themselves on their recorded game casts on Youtube. It was initially just a way to entertain myself, like watching movies, but I've realized that I've internalized crucial life skills applicable for a software engineer through those games.

The first and most striking parallel between AOE4 and infrastructure engineering lies in the ability to **manage multiple tasks simultaneously**. In any given AOE4 match, players find themselves juggling a multitude of responsibilities: constructing buildings, managing resource production, training troops, scouting the enemy, and reacting to unexpected attacks. This mirrors the daily reality of an infrastructure engineer, who may be **juggling multiple projects, addressing server outages, and troubleshooting network issues, all while adhering to strict deadlines**.

Watching professional players navigate these complexities is an educational experience. They excel at **prioritization and division of labor**, delegating tasks to villagers for resource gathering while simultaneously commanding their military to harass the opponent. This strategic allocation of resources translates directly to how I have to organize the various demands of my everyday job. By **prioritizing critical tasks, delegating effectively to the team, and maintaining a clear overview of ongoing projects**, I can get better the demands of their role.

The ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously, while crucial, is just one piece of the puzzle. AOE4 esports also fosters the development of **critical decision-making skills** under pressure. In the midst of a competitive match, players face rapid changes in the battlefield, requiring them to analyze situations quickly, make calculated decisions, and adapt their strategies on the fly. This translates directly to the **fast-paced environment of infrastructure engineering**, where unforeseen technical issues can arise at any moment.

An engineer, for instance, might be overseeing a critical system upgrade when an unexpected network outage throws a wrench into the plan. Just as an AOE4 player must assess the situation, identify the cause of the disruption, and adjust their strategy accordingly, the engineer needs to **analyze the situation, identify the root cause of the outage, and devise a solution** to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth system upgrade. 

AOE4 often tests a player's ability to **remain calm and focused** under pressure. High-stakes tournaments can be nerve-wracking, and maintaining composure in the face of potential defeat is essential for success. Similarly, infrastructure engineers often work under tight deadlines and face the potential for significant consequences if mistakes occur. By learning from AOE4 players who demonstrate the ability to **stay calm under pressure and make sound decisions** in high-stress situations, an engineer can develop the resilience and composure necessary to effectively navigate the challenges of their profession.

Beyond individual decision-making, AOE4 also emphasizes the importance of **teamwork and communication** in achieving success. Professional AOE4 matches often involve team games, where players need to **coordinate their strategies, communicate effectively, and support each other** to overcome their opponents. This collaborative spirit directly translates to the **team-oriented environment of infrastructure engineering**. 

Just as AOE4 players rely on clear communication and coordinated efforts to achieve victory, an engineer relies on their team to successfully manage complex projects. Through their experience with AOE4 esports, the engineer has honed their **communication skills**, allowing them to **articulate complex technical concepts** to colleagues, **delegate tasks effectively**, and **build trust and collaboration** within their team. This, in turn, fosters a more efficient and productive work environment.

One of the most captivating aspects of AOE4 esports is the **emphasis on long-term planning**. The opening minutes of a match, often referred to as the **"early game,"** are crucial for setting the stage for success later on. Skilled AOE4 players meticulously plan their **build order**, a sequence of actions that determines the initial construction of buildings and units. This strategic foresight directly translates to the approach engineers take when tackling complex infrastructure projects.

Understanding the long-term implications of decisions is paramount in the field of infrastructure engineering. When designing and implementing new systems, engineers go beyond addressing immediate needs and consider **potential future requirements and scalability**. This future-oriented mindset ensures the **resilience and adaptability** of the infrastructure they build in the face of evolving needs.

For example, an engineer planning the upgrade of a company's data center might not just focus on immediate capacity needs. By drawing inspiration from AOE4 players who plan their build orders with expansion in mind, the engineer might consider including **additional infrastructure capacity** to accommodate projected growth in the coming years. This proactive approach ensures the data center remains **functional and efficient** as the company's requirements evolve.

Furthermore, AOE4 players often **scout the map and analyze their opponent's strategies** early in the game. This **intelligence gathering** allows them to adapt their own plans and anticipate potential challenges. Similarly, engineers in the real world engage in thorough **planning and risk assessment** before embarking on large-scale projects. This involves researching existing infrastructure, identifying potential roadblocks, and developing contingency plans to address any unforeseen issues. By proactively anticipating potential challenges, engineers can **minimize disruptions** and ensure the smooth execution of projects.

**Resource Management: Optimizing Allocation**

Similar to the demanding resource management in AOE4, engineers must navigate a complex landscape of **limited resources and diverse needs**. In a typical AOE4 game, players need to effectively manage various resources like food, wood, gold, and stone to construct buildings, train troops, and research technologies. This requires careful **allocation and balancing** to achieve their strategic goals. An engineer, too, faces similar challenges. They must manage and allocate resources such as **budget, personnel, and time** across diverse projects, ensuring efficient utilization and achieving optimal outcomes.

By observing AOE4 players **prioritize resource gathering** and **optimize production chains** to maximize efficiency, an engineer can learn valuable lessons. For instance, the engineer might analyze the time and resources required for different project components and **prioritize tasks** accordingly. Alternatively, they might identify areas where **automation or resource pooling** can be implemented to streamline processes and optimize resource allocation.

Furthermore, AOE4 players often need to **adapt their resource management strategies** based on the **changing dynamics of the game**. For example, if they encounter an unexpected enemy attack, they might need to divert resources from building construction to focus on military production. Similarly, an engineer may encounter **unforeseen challenges** during a project that require **adapting resource allocation**. They might need to **reprioritize tasks, reallocate personnel, or seek additional resources** to address the situation effectively.

**Embracing Change and Innovation: The Constant Need to Adapt**
