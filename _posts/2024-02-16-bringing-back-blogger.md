This essay proposes a plan for revitalization of Google Blogger. I argue for a premium subscription model, trendy features powered by Gemini AI , and a focus on actual user needs, not perceived ones. This is a high-level summary of a much detailed documentation I'm working on.

Blogger, once the dominant force in the 'Blogosphere', has stagnated in recent years. It's not like the whole blog/newsletter market is less viable these days either. Competitors like Medium, Substack, and Ghost have thrived in the 'writing and publishing' space. Other companies in adjacent and very similar field, like Squarespace and Wix have done great and received multi-billion valuations. Blogger has remained mostly unchanged, its ability to attract and retain users is limited. 

I love Blogger. I have used it since 2007, writing over 7000 posts and 2.4+ Million words in my personal journal using the Blogger platform. So it hurts me greatly the product has remained stagnant (and not in a good way) for the past two decades. There have been limited changes or updates in the product since the early 2010's.

Here I present high-level ideas to revamp the product. I will go into specifics in future posts.

## The potential of a Premium Blogger

Blogger should look into a subscription-based premium version.

Introducing a premium tier opens a revenue stream, beyond ad revenue. Just working towards a premium subscription-based product would force the team to clarify its vision. Such a version could offer features for power bloggers, such as:

__AI-powered writing tools__: Google's LLM Gemini can help bloggers of all skill levels. Consider a writing assistant that provides sensible grammar and phrasing suggestions. It could offer feedback to re-organize the content. The feedback would be personalized based on the user's writing history and style. Such a tool would be useful to bloggers looking to improve their writing and improve reader engagement.

__Better editing tools__: It's surprising that basic features like word count, and other editing tools are currently missing from Blogger. The free version of Blogger should have these features, to have a baseline experience comparable to competitors. The premium tier could offer advanced features, like grammar checking, stylistic suggestions, and plagiarism detection.

__Writing tutor based on past writing__: Gemini (Alphabet's AI product) can act as personalized writing tutor for users. By analyzing a user's writing history, the AI can identify recurring errors, overused phrases, and suggest alternative wordings or sentences. Such feedback would help creators improve their writing and refine their craft. The AI tutor could also link to relevant past blog posts within a user's content (on demand). That would improve internal linking and help readers discover more relevant material in the website.

## Other Strategic Advantages

The potential benefits of a revitalized Blogger extend beyond generating additional revenue for Google. By adding  prioritizing user needs, Google can achieve several objectives:

__Distinguishing "clean data" from "AI-assisted data"__: As users interact with the AI editing tools, Google can gain understanding of the editing process. By observing how the AI suggestions are accepted, modified, or rejected, the company can develop a clearer understanding of how humans and AI interact with language. This knowledge can be important for differentiating between human-generated and AI-assisted content, a growing concern in the digital age.
__Building user trust__: Investing in the development and improvement of Blogger shows Google's commitment to creating useful products beyond ad revenue generation. This commitment can strengthen trust and goodwill among users, who will appreciate that Google is actively working to enhance their experience. This positive perception can translate into increased user engagement and loyalty to the platform.

These advantages, coupled with the potential for financial gain, make a good case for Google to prioritize the revitalization of Blogger. However, it is vital to acknowledge and address the underlying challenges that have contributed to the platform's decline in recent years.

## Identifying the cause of the existing situation

Several key factors have hindered Blogger's growth and contributed to its current state:

__Over-reliance on ad revenue__: Google's primary focus on ad-based income has overshadowed the potential of exploring alternative monetization models. This over-reliance has limited investment in product development and innovation specifically for Blogger. It has hindered its ability to compete with platforms that offer premium features and subscription options.
__Lack of vision and user focus__: The absence of a clear vision for Blogger's future, coupled with a disconnect from user needs, has led to stagnation and a lack of direction. This has allowed competitors to surpass Blogger by offering innovative features, user-friendly interfaces, and a strong focus on the specific needs of bloggers.
__Engineering-centric culture__: Google's emphasis on engineering talent and an interview process prioritizing specific skillsets may inadvertently overlook important aspects for successful product development in creative fields. While engineering excellence is undoubtedly important, encouraging a culture that values product vision, user empathy, and understanding of specific market segments is equally important for products like Blogger to thrive.
__Aversion to customer interaction__: Google's perceived anti-customer behavior, evident in its approach to handling support requests, may deter the company from exploring subscription models, which  need direct user interaction and a commitment to providing responsive customer support. This reluctance to engage with users can hinder the development of a strong and loyal user base.

## Addressing the Challenges

Moving forward, Google must adopt a multifaceted approach to revitalize Blogger and ensure its long-term success:

__Hire visionary leaders__: All of the challenges I mention earlier could be solved if Alphabet prioritized product and engineering leaders with a clear vision of the product, who are bold enough to take small risks, and sell their ambitious goals for the product to the management. It's  clear the product has been served by managers, administrators who are great at maintaining the status quo who falter at uncertainty and risky projects. Alphabet needs to invest in leaders, not managers to rejuvenate Blogger.
__Prioritize user research and feedback__: Understanding the changing needs and preferences of bloggers is important for successful product development. Google should conduct regular user research and gather feedback through surveys, focus groups, and user testing to gain a deeper understanding of what bloggers want and need from a blogging platform.
__Embrace diverse talent__: Create a culture that values and rewards not only engineering prowess but also product vision, user empathy, and an understanding of the specific needs of the blogger community is important. This requires a more holistic approach to talent acquisition and development, ensuring that the team responsible for Blogger possesses the diverse skillsets and perspectives needed to drive innovation and success.
__Explore alternative monetization models__: Experimenting with subscription models, alongside exploring other potential revenue sources beyond just advertising, can provide sustainable income and lessen dependence on a single source of revenue. This financial diversification can allow Google to invest in long-term product development and innovation for Blogger, ensuring its continued competitiveness in the market.

## Conclusion:

By creating a premium LLM-powered version, researching and solving user needs, and adopting customer-centric approach, Google can potentially revitalize Blogger. It would be able to gain the lost ground in the blogging space too. Such a transition would create new sources of revenue, improve user experience, and take Blogger back to its former glory.
