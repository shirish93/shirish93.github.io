In her book *Learning to Learn* psychologist and researcher Gloria Flores argues that the key to a mindset open, receptive to learning is to manage one's 'moods'. She argues that only by modifying the less-productive (for learning) moods towards more productive ones, does learning get easier.

**Introduction**
Learning is not just something that's done in school anymore. We have to keep learning to keep in pace with the changing world: learn how to use a new app, learn to search on the web, learn a new job skill, learn to use generative ai, and so forth. Mastering new skills can be emotionally challenging, making the process of learning a hard one. Gloria P. Flores, a corporate trainer and psychologist, proposes a curious approach in her book, *"Learning to Learn and the Navigation of Moods"*. 

Flores argues that "learning to learn" is a distinct skill, and the key lies in understanding and managing the emotional shifts that accompany learning.  She identifies common emotional pitfalls, from beginner confusion to expert arrogance, and offers strategies to navigate them.  This book targets a wide audience, from students to professionals seeking to refine their skills.

**Empowering Learners Through Emotional Management**

Flores goes beyond stating that learning involves navigating moods. Her core thesis is that effective learning hinges on managing emotional shifts throughout the process. These shifts are predictable, varying with our competence level. The book promises to teach skills to transform unproductive moods like overwhelm into more conducive ones like ambition. This emotional self-management, according to Flores, is key to unlocking one's full learning potential.  

* **Strengths:** The book excels in providing compelling case studies demonstrating the impact of Flores' framework. Readers see firsthand how individuals transformed unproductive moods, making the presented strategies feel relevant.  Additionally, Flores demonstrates impressive knowledge, blending research findings with personal anecdotes, building a strong case for the impact of mood management on learning. The information seems current and relevant, especially for software development professionals.

* **Weaknesses:** The book primarily focuses on awareness of mood shifts rather than offering specific mood modulation techniques. While case studies showcase results, they lack concrete steps for actively reshaping moods. Readers seeking a more prescriptive guide might find it lacking.

Flores' dual background as a corporate trainer and psychologist lends credibility to the book. Her experience allows her to delve into the connection between emotions and learning, offering insights grounded in both theory and practice. Furthermore, her family background in learning research strengthens her credibility. While the book focuses on managing emotions for learning effectiveness, it offers in-depth guidance on a crucial aspect.

Flores employs a clear and engaging writing style, authoritative yet approachable. She effectively utilizes real-life anecdotes and case studies. The book benefits from a well-organized structure, logically guiding readers through the process. However, some might find the reliance on case studies overwhelming. 

**Overall Recommendation**

*"Learning to Learn and the Navigation of Moods"* offers a valuable framework for understanding the impact of emotions on learning. Flores's expertise and engaging style make the book accessible. While the use of case studies might feel repetitive, the real-world examples strengthen the core message. This book is recommended for learners of all levels, especially those with a growth mindset seeking to optimize their learning potential. Software engineers and leaders navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape will find the book's focus on managing emotions for improved learning effectiveness particularly relevant.

I have bought two copies of book to give as gift to friends, and will buy more copies as needed. Highly recommend!
