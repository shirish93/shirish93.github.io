Planned "unfocused" activities can enhance your cognitive toolkit. In "Tinker Dabble Doodle Try: The Power of an Unfocused Mind," Dr. Srini Pillay challenges the idea that laser-sharp focus is the key to success.

## Introduction

Great problem-solving skills and innovative thinking are vital to get an edge over competitors. Dr. Srini Pillay's "Tinker Dabble Doodle Try: The Power of an Unfocused Mind" offers a surprising suggestion how to inculcate such skills. Dr. Pillay, a Harvard neuropsychiatrist, challenges the long-held belief that laser-focused concentration is the key to success. Instead, he advocates for deliberately incorporating "unfocused" mental states. By improving at tinkering, dabbling, and doodling, creativity, and problem-solving abilities are improved. So claims the book.

Delivered as an audiobook (the version that I 'read'), the book translates scientific concepts into digestible morsels of knowledge. This comes at the cost of specific points being less accessible compared to printed format. WThe book targets individuals experiencing "diffuse focus," but it's message aligns with engineers in all situations. That includes those who excel with "narrow focus" and seek to expand their cognitive flexibility and 'breakthrough thinking'. Dr. Pillay differentiates between two types of focus: the concentrated "beam" for execution and the expansive "diffuse" focus for generating outside-the-box ideas.

Dr. Pillay's core message is clear and immediately relevant to engineers. Planned "unfocused" activities can enhance your cognitive toolkit. He backs his claims with a combination of scientific research, personal anecdotes, and practical exercises. The science is interesting and relevant, though its depth might vary depending on the reader's prior knowledge of neuroscience. The practical techniques and examples are presented in a clear, relatable manner, making them easily applicable.

As an engineer, the book's core message felt true to me. Stepping away from problems, exploring unlikely possibilities, and letting go of rigid thinking are practices that can lead to new breakthroughs. The book effectively highlights this takeaway: fixation isn't always the solution. This will go well with those whose job involves solving tricky challenges daily. Folks who encounter 'aha!' moments just as they focus away from the problem will strongly identify with the book's message.

There are significant portions of the book that I didn't like, however.

Some aspects of the book won't work with a technical audience. The mix of scientific evidence and practical recommendations is great. However it includes topics like tantric sex and unproven brainwaves. That felt out of place and pseudoscientific. This hinders the book's credibility for readers wanting a serious reading.

Additionally, some recommendations in later chapters, were overly optimistic and lacked concrete application.

"Tinker Dabble Doodle Try" makes good points in favor of the power of "unfocused" thinking. Its effectiveness would be improved by focusing on practical techniques, and omitting irrelevant and non-scientific topics. The book shines when it gets into practical techniques and case studies directly relevant to software engineers. 

### Key Strengths

1. Combating Fixation: The book provides tools for recognizing and overcoming "fixation bias". Techniques like "deliberate breaks," "unplanned activities," and "seeking diverse perspectives" can help folks approach problems from new angles and generate fresh ideas. I've written extensively on the 'diverse perspectives' angle elsewhere on this blog.

2. Enhancing Creativity: The book offers several exercises to stimulate creative thinking, particularly useful for tackling complex design challenges. Experimenting with new technologies, exploring different programming languages, or engaging in artistic pursuits can spark unexpected connections and lead to out-of-the-box solutions.

3. Boosting Problem-Solving: The book explains into how "unfocused" activities can improve problem-solving skills. Techniques like "mind-mapping," "brainstorming in unusual settings," and "using metaphors" can help readers break down complex problems. They can identify hidden patterns, and arrive at more elegant solutions.

4. Encouraging Teamwork: The book emphasizes the importance of enabling a culture of "unfocused exploration". Joint brainstorming sessions, hackathons, and even encouraging team members to pursue personal hobbies unrelated to work can lead to cross-pollination of ideas and unexpected breakthroughs. I've written on the final point [here]]({% post_url 2024-02-17-diverse-hobbies %}) 

5. Promoting Adaptability: The book's message of embracing "unfocused" activities encourages flexible thinking, openness to new ideas, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. They are all useful skills for engineers.
