Mathurā is at the center of the Kṛṣṇa story, but Kṛṣṇa is not in Mathurā.
Upon this paradox, in its various expressions and ramifications, more
than a century of scholarship has constructed for us its image of multiple
Kṛṣṇas. This is not the place to account for them all. I have tried to
do this for most of them elsewhere.6 Suffice it to say that the analytical
atomists continue to do their work, and that, despite determined efforts
to keep the list short, the reductions to two, three, or four Kṛṣṇas are
never quite identical. There is inevitable overlap, and no two scholars
apply the scalpel in exactly the same way. Now, the city of Mathurā
is consistently found on several of the lines of dissection. Born in
Mathurā as a Κṣatriya, Kṛṣṇa is taken away to Vraja to be raised as a
cowherd, and returns to Mathurā as a cowherd to recover his identity
as a Κṣatriya. Does Mathurā then belong to ‘Kṛṣṇa the cowherd,’ or to
‘Kṛṣṇa the Kṣatriya,’ or again to the ‘pastoral demigod’ or ‘folk deity,’
or to the ‘divinized’ kṣatriya hero? Since both the Mahābhārata and
the Harivaṃ śa tell of his conflicts with king Jarāsaṃdha of Magadha,
does one connect Kṛṣṇa’s resultant flight from Mathurā to Dvārakā
with the ‘earlier’ epic Kṛṣṇa (who operates entirely from Dvārakā),
or with the ‘later popular’ Kṛṣṇa of the Harivaṃ śa and the Vaiṣṇava
Purāṇas (texts in which Dvārakā stories proliferate)?
