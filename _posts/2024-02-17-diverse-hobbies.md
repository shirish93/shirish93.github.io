Having a diverse set of interests allows you to look at the world in different ways. Pick up a weird hobby, or a new craft. If nothing else, it'll help you do your job better.

**From mad-scientist to Problem-Solver**

Picture a software engineer. Does the mental image include large vats with strange gloop floating? Does it include paintbrushes or knitting needles at all? I am a software engineer, and I happen to have many diverse hobbies. One of them is fermentation.

My journey fermenting diverse foods and drinks brought an unexpected revelation. Most human skills and interests are 'cross-related'. By excelling in one field, you're cross training for something entirely different. Diverse hobbies can unlock wide perspectives for engineers. They can help them tackle complex challenges. We will explore how seemingly unrelated pursuits can help cultivate useful skills. We will discuss how it can help foster creativity and innovation.

Technical expertise remains, of course, fundamental for engineers. But engineers who explore interests beyond their field discover a trove of benefits.
First, diverse interests expand their "toolset" for problem-solving. Imagine an engineer with a background in music approaching an interface design challenge. Their understanding of sound and rhythm could translate into user-friendly interfaces for individuals with auditory issues. This "cross-pollination" of knowledge lets engineers make unexpected connections, leading to novel solutions.

Diverse interests help people gain a stronger sense of empathy, an important and underrated quality in engineers. By looking through unrelated 'problem-solving' lenses, they understand diverse needs and perspectives. An engineer who's a woodworker might approach design with a keen eye for user experience. This could ensure their creations are functional as well as aesthetically, like a furniture. This empathy would create better user relationships and ultimately lead to more 'customer-oriented' solutions.

My experience with fermentation has shown me the ways my hobbies help 'cross-train' me. As I experiment with different ferments I have learned skills in adaptability, problem-solving, and grit. These skills proved served me when when I worked on an internal project that involved building the first internal-facing GPU Kubernetes cluster at Solaria Labs. My experience with the project reflected the seemingly unpredictable pauses and accelerations in fermentation. The project demanded I be flexible and ready to improvise. Just as I must blend two brews if one doesn't meet my expectations, I learned to choose a less-than-ideal option if my way didn't work. Ultimately, the problem-solving mindset that I have learned through my fermentation hobby proved to be useful in the project's success.

**Broader Implications**

Technical expertise is the bedrock of engineering, but a singular focus can create a tunnel vision. Such narrow perspective, limited to established methods and familiar solutions, can overlook important concerns. Issues like actual user needs, ethical considerations, and changing technology landscape because afterthoughts for the perfect technical solution. By diversifying one's interests, one can provide as a potent antidote to the restricted understanding. That equips an engineer with the multi-dimensional perspective and a flexible approach to problem solving.

Consider the unfortunate case of the Ford Pinto, where cost-cutting measures prioritized over safety resulted in [fatal design flaws](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6700/top-automotive-engineering-failures-ford-pinto-fuel-tanks/). This example highlights the dangers of tunnel vision. Engineers, fixated on technical specifications, failed to anticipate the broader social and ethical implications of their work. In contrast, an engineer with a background in social psychology might have foreseen the human cost of such decisions, advocating for a user-centric design approach.

Beyond ethical considerations, a limited perspective can hinder innovation itself. Sticking to established methods stifles exploration of alternative approaches, potentially leading to inefficient solutions. History is strewn with examples where breakthroughs emerged from seemingly unrelated fields. The Wright brothers, inspired by birdwatching, revolutionized transportation with their flying machine. Velcro, [originally designed](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/technology/item/who-came-up-with-the-idea-for-velcro/) to capture burrs on animals, has found myriad applications in diverse industries. Diverse personal interests can similarly spark unexpected connections. Engineers are empowered to view problems from different angles and arrive at interesting solutions.

**Beyond Technical Jargon**

Communication and team-work are foundational in successful engineering projects. A lack of diverse perspectives can undermine clear communication and hinder partnerships. Imagine a team of engineers with identical backgrounds trying to explain a complex technical concept to a diverse group of stakeholders. Their limited understanding of the audience perspective could lead to miscommunication and frustration. An engineer who enjoys theater might leverage their experience in storytelling and audience engagement to communicate complex ideas effectively. This would get an easier cooperation and buy-in from stakeholders than even the best technical message.

Imagine an engineer, solely focused on traditional construction methods. Faced with the rapid rise of 3D printing technology, their ability to adapt and embrace innovation might hinder their technical output. Conversely, imagine an engineer with a passion for tinkering and experimenting. Due to hobbies like robotics or woodworking, they might readily embrace new technologies. This would help them upskill and adapt to changing landscape.

**Conclusion**

Diverse interests ignite innovation in unexpected ways. An engineer who's an artist, is better at his job than one whose main hobby is programming, in designing UI's. Imagine a musician optimizing data processing, drawing from his musical composition interest to optimize algorithms. Think of the soccer player leading joint projects, using collaboration skills to encourage innovation. Picture the writer crafting clear technical communication, making collaboration simpler through user-friendly documentation. These are just a few examples of how engineers can harness interests to achieve remarkable results. By embracing diverse interests, engineers unlock creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving potential.
