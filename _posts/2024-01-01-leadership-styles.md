To help engineering leaders understand themselves, and evaluate the best way to leverage their skillset, here's a novel lens to seeing yourself

## The Multidimensional Landscape of Engineering Leadership

### Introduction

Leadership in engineering is a delicate balance, demanding both technical proficiency and inspiring vision. While taking Technical Leadership course offered University of Washington-Seattle's Engineering Leadership program, I realized the frameworks offered didn't quite satisfy how I envisioned myself as a leader, or what I expected from engineering leaders in my organizations. Over the last year or so, I have developed a novel way of understanding the skills and roles of such leaders.

Traditional leadership theories, while valuable, often fall short when capturing the intricate demands of the engineering field. In this essay I introduce a novel perspective: a multidimensional framework that illuminates the multifaceted nature of engineering leadership. It empowers both leaders and followers to navigate this complex terrain with greater understanding and effectiveness.

### The Multidimensional Framework

This framework transcends singular leadership styles, instead recognizing the interplay of four distinct dimensions:

1. **Spiritual:** The ability to inspire vision, meaning, and purpose within the team.
2. **Technical:** The expertise and innovation driving projects forward.
3. **Personal:** The guidance, mentorship, and interpersonal skills fostering individual growth.
4. **Inspirational/Celebrity:** The impact on a broader community through exceptional work and influence.

By exploring these dimensions, leaders can identify their unique strengths and areas for development, fostering self-awareness and growth. For followers, the framework unlocks a deeper understanding of the diverse leadership styles they encounter, enabling them to identify the leaders who resonate most with their individual needs and aspirations.

What is important to understand is that a leader can excel at any one of these skills, and make for an excellent example for their charges, while failing in all the others. Or they can focus on building multiple strengths, and provide well-rounded guidance to others. Regardless, my proposed framework provides an opportunity for flexibility in interpretating what a good engineering leader can be which most existing framework don't completely clarify.

**Imagine** a software engineer drawn to the technical brilliance of a solutions architect, while a product owner finds solace and motivation in the philosophical leadership of another. This framework encourages such nuanced appreciation, recognizing that different leaders excel in different dimensions, they contribute uniquely to the collective success of an engineering team.

A quote often (wrongly) attributed to Mark Twain goes: _Only kings, presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial ‘we’._ Despite that, I will refer to myself in the plural hereon, as the framework, once out in the work doesn't belong to my person anymore. Let us proceed.

Throughout this essay, we delve deeper into each dimension, exploring key attributes, strengths, and potential limitations of each. We showcase real-world examples of engineering leaders who embody these characteristics, highlighting the impact of their diverse styles.

#### Spiritual Leadership

* **Key Attributes:** Vision setting, purpose definition, ethical leadership, fostering team culture.
* **Strengths:** Motivates and inspires teams, creates a sense of community, drives innovation through shared values.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be overly idealistic, may neglect pragmatic details, potential for manipulation.
* **Example:** Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, known for his commitment to protecting the environment and sustainability, before it became trendy. He aligned his company's mission towards his vision despite it being at odds with profitability.

A spiritual leader shows the path...and vision...for the long term. They may not guide you technically, or help you in your day-to-day work, but their vision and mission of what is to be done, and what should be done is so strong, you can't but be allured by the possibilities. You are driven to your work to work towards their vision, overcoming for their other potential deficiencies in technical or personal aspects by finding other means.

#### Technical Leadership

* **Key Attributes:** Deep technical expertise, problem-solving skills, innovation, driving project execution.
* **Strengths:** Builds trust through competence, delivers results efficiently, ensures technical solutions are sound.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be overly focused on technical details, neglect communication and team dynamics, potentially miss the bigger picture.
* **Example:** Grace Hopper (leading the development of COBOL and revolutionizing programming languages)

A technical leader bedazzles with their technical skills, quick-wittedness, ability to come to anybody's assitance at a moment's notice and immediacy in identifying the issue at hand. They gain respect by their sharpened skills in their field of expertise, and inspire others because of their sheer intelligence, work ethic and competence. The followers want to become them, be even tenth as effective and productive as they are, and even if they are not great at vision-setting or inspiring, or helping at a personal level, it doesn't matter, because their technical expertise trumps all.

#### Personal Leadership

* **Key Attributes:** Strong interpersonal skills, mentoring and coaching, fostering individual growth, building trust and rapport.
* **Strengths:** Creates a positive and supportive work environment, helps individuals reach their full potential, promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be overly individualistic, neglecting the collective needs of the team, potential for favoritism.
* **Example:** Somebody's team lead, could be a great mentor!

Leaders with this style foster your personal growth, watch out for your potential career-wise, guide you towards tools and techniques to improve yourself, and make sure you're performing the best you can. They empower you to push yourself as hard as you can go, and make you understand the worth of your work. They clear the blockers standing on your way, and help you see your mission more clearly. They touch you at a personal level, as a mentor.

#### Inspirational/Celebrity Leadership

* **Key Attributes:** Charisma, public influence, motivating large audiences, building brand recognition.
* **Strengths:** Drives external interest and investment, attracts top talent, inspires broader social impact.
* **Weaknesses:** Can be susceptible to ego and fame, may neglect internal team needs, focus more on external perception than internal reality.
* **Example:** Steve Jobs (inspiring a generation with innovative products and captivating presentations)

This kind of leadership is not necessarily related to one's field, but can be. This sort of leader has such charm, charisma, and drive that onlookers can't but help be inspired and driven. These leaders are great at being celebrities too, and use their influence in all the right ways. They might not know you personally, but they will have changed millions of lives for the better through charisma and ability. While Steve Jobs is an obvious example, I want to give another example of Julia Evans [who](jvns.ca) maintains an excellent tech blog, give public presentations, and inspired me to start working on this website.

### Potential Pitfalls

However, overemphasizing any single dimension within the multidimensional framework can lead to potential pitfalls, hindering both individual and team success. Here's a breakdown of the possible downsides for each dimension:

**Spiritual Leadership**

* Overly idealistic vision
* Neglecting pragmatic details
* Ethical manipulation

**Technical Leadership**

* Technical elitism
* Neglecting communication and team dynamics
* Missing the bigger picture

**Personal Leadership**

* Overly individualistic focus
