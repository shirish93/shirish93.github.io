For a software engineer, technical expertise is clearly of the highest importance. However, their attitude towards problem solving can significantly shape how they get their everyday tasks accomplished too. Through a hobby of mine I've discovered an unexpected wellspring of professional growth. Fermentation. This seemingly random hobby has become a secret weapon, helping me hone skills relevant to my engineering career.

**Lessons from the Unknown:**

The challenges I face in my fermenting hobby, and in my job as a software infrastructure engineer are quite similar. Learning from one has helped me improve in the other.

Here's an important example to prove my point: last year I had to replicate a rice wine recipe across different locations. Unexpected variations in temperature, water, and even starter cultures produced unexpected results. That was something I'd never experienced before in years of homebrewing at my apartment. It could have ended up as a frustrating experience, but there were reasons to be optimistic. A case of missing yeast addition -- because I'd run out of my regular brand -- led to a brew with delightful aroma, where wild yeast strains created a fruity smell. The professional yeast of the type I regularly use would have fermented that away. In a different situation, I learned the usefulness of changing the ratio of rice mold to start ferment, as we were able to culture our own mold strain due to less-than-ideal weather conditions. These experiences were similar to my experience as a software engineer, where everyday brings surprise and a new opportunities for learning. My brewing hobby has made me appreciate the value of embracing the unknown, an important mindset to cultivate as a software engineer.

**Patience is a Virtue (and a Line of Code):**

Crafting exquisite fermented products requires patience. Good tempeh or kombucha demands waiting â€“ weeks, months, or even years. Similarly, well-designed software applications often involve planning, iterative testing, and the understanding that quality takes time. My fermentation hobby has instilled this patience, allowing me to trust the process, focus on progress, and approach projects with a long-term vision, leading to more sustainable and successful software solutions. Just as my amazing batch of chhyang (Nepali rice beer) won't complete in a week no matter how excited I am, the project at work won't be done until the proper timelines are reached.

**Adapting on the Fly:**

The art of fermentation thrives on the unexpected. Unlike sterile software development labs, fermentation projects are full of curveballs. A cold snap can slow a ferment, a batch might develop its own flavors, and online recipes will often yield unpredictable results. These deviations have become opportunities to teach myself to be flexible, and adapt the recipes when things don't work out my way. These skills directly translate to software engineering.

The summer heatwave of two years ago almost ruined a batch of kimchi. Having experienced something similar with kombucha temperature fluctuations, I improvised with ice packs and refrigeration inside a insulated chamber originally bought to heat my seed germination pods. I had to check the kimchi regularly, adjusting salt content and fermentation time, something that doesn't need to be done. The result was a interesting, slightly spicier and funkier kimchi, a proof that by adapting to unexpected situations I was able to save the ferment.

As a software engineer, when dependencies shift, bugs are discovered, urgent security vulnerabilities need to be fixed, or client requirements change, they become opportunities to apply my fermentation-honed resilience. Just as I brought back my at-risk ferments, I can think on my feet, analyze situation with the understanding the final result will still be acceptable, and devise solutions that move the project forward.

My fermentation experience has equipped me with mental models that translate directly to software development. Just as understanding the relationship between microorganisms, temperature, and pH levels influences fermentation, I can now approach software development with a more holistic perspective. I consider not just individual lines of code, but the entire ecosystem in which they function, anticipating potential interactions and dependencies that might otherwise lead to unforeseen issues. Software engineering is not just about code, it's about product requirements, people, marketing, and a long-term vision, with software just aligning us on the right track. Having that understanding puts everyday challenges in better context.

The most significant impact of my fermentation hobby is in its encouragement of continuous learning. In software development, failures often carry a negative connotation. However, fermentation has taught me to view challenges as opportunities for improvement. When experiments go awry, they are not discarded as failures. Instead I think back to identify missteps, and apply those learnings to future projects, because I want to improve the next batch. This approach has made me appreciate continuous improvement, encouraging open communication about challenges and supporting a team-driven environment where learning trumps finger-pointing.

Fermentation is not without its share of "mishaps." Off-odors, unexpected textures, and even failed batches are all part of the learning process. These "failures" provide important lessons and force me to refine my techniques. Similarly, in software development, encountering bugs and errors is inevitable. My fermentation hobby has instilled a 'growth mindset', I have begun seeing challenges as opportunities for learning and improvement. Approaching failures with a calm determination, dissecting the issue, learning from it, and applying that knowledge to future projects, is the less stressful and more productive way, it turns out.

While most ferments make delicious and safe products, the potential for contamination or harmful bacteria requires great care and strict hygiene practices. Similarly, software security demands constant awareness of potential vulnerabilities and proactive measures to prevent data breaches and malicious attacks. My focus on maintaining a clean environment and identifying potential risks during fermentation translates into a heightened awareness of software security risks. I've become more proactive in implementing security measures, staying updated on vulnerabilities, and responding  to potential threats, because I don't want to experience 'spoiled batch'.

**Conclusion**

Ny journey with fermentation has taught me this: exploring diverse interests can bring unexpected benefits that improve and assist our professional lives. The patience cultivated through waiting for a perfectly aged rice beer, the analytical thinking sharpened from monitoring variables, and the adaptability developed from dealing with unknown issue in my hobby have translated into invaluable skills that make have made me a better software engineer. It doesn't end with code. From baking sourdough to dancing, every exploration can equip us with different perspectives. I suggest you step outside your comfort zone, explore your passion, and internalize the benefits diverse interests. Your next great idea might be brewing in the most unexpected place!
