<p>I want discuss my philosophy of photos and illustrations (on this blog) and the value of human creation. The context is that I will be eventually replacing all of the AI-generated images on this website with my hand-drawn illustrations. One day I'll also include photos and illustrations by my friends or people I know. I will only include works I know to be human-created and not barfed out by generative AI networks. </p>

<p>These are the questions I hope to address with this piece. Why do I care about this? Why do I want to maintain a stance that makes my life so hard? And what do I hope to achieve, putting in so much effort for something as simple as blog illustrations? Who would care if I put my full focus on the blog posts themselves and then put two or three minutes of effort into generating the images? Would that not make the quality of my writing better?</p>

<p>I'll start with the last question first.  Would it not be a better idea to spend less time worrying about illustrations and focusing fully on the write-up and outsource the illustrations to the machines? My answer is, at that point, why not outsource the writing itself to the machine as well? Why not generate some AI slop that everybody seems to be pushing out, and then add ai illustrations on the blog and call it a day? That would be much faster. I could focus myself on bigger ideas and more important things and be done!</p>

<p>Now, that's not a completely fair take. One could say that there is an advantage of specialization. Some people are writers. Some people are illustrators. Is it really that big of a deal if a writer decides to outsource the illustration work to somebody else?</p>

<p>My response is no, not if the other person is a human being, because they are still valuing the art, the craft, the experience, and understanding of the other person. But by assigning image generation to the machine, we are, of course, undermining the value and putting less importance on what the art means.</p>

<p>To put it differently, if the illustrator was doing a lot of illustrations and then outsourcing the text to the machines, of course, it's clear they are not valuing the text as much as they are. And if everybody does that, devaluing all human creative skills in favor of the drossâ€”mid, boring, and  cheap machine-generated art, that  doesn't provoke curiosity, introspection, or understanding. </p>

<p>Why is that? It's because you understand there was no motivation or agency that went behind the creation of that image. It was image generation by lottery and not by intent. When you remove intent from the process of creation, you remove the meaning in it.</p>

<p>It becomes a meaningless, nihilistic object that exists by itself. But you say, "Oh, I did have intention in generating that image by giving it the prompt. Isn't that intent enough?" And my answer is no. Saying, "I want this, get me this something," is not intent. If somebody spent 45 minutes, an hour, two hours poring over and thinking about what they want and how they want and eventually created it, I would be much more aligned to agree. The entire point of using machine-generated art is to avoid the question of intent and agency entirely. It's also different from putting art or illustrations or images by other people because they had agency and intent and a vision in creating that art.</p>

<p>Posting meaningless art, by definition, implies that you don't value intent. You don't value understanding, and you don't value the process that went into creation. The effort is undermined. For me, blogging, writing, illustrating, creating the website is all about intent. It's about the process. It's about the journey. Why? Because why else would I do that?</p>

<p>It's not like it's a magic keyword you can speak, like 'khulja sim sim' or 'open sesame,' that opens up new job opportunities as people originally thought. If it were to be the case, the action of speaking the magic word would be so devalued that opening magical caves would be commonplace. It would not be respected.</p>

<p>The whole point of putting your stuff online is to show your ability, to show your intent, to show your effort, to show your understanding of the world. It is to display that you have a clear, specific vision and framing of looking at the world, and that that understanding can be generalized and can be used by your future employer. It is not to show your future employers that you are capable of using a cheap tool in a lazy manner.</p>

<p>Because if everybody can do that, everybody can produce lukewarm, average, pointless text, then what exactly is the value of that lukewarm, pointless text? Intent and the journey matter a lot in a world where people pretend AI can do a lot, which is why I prioritize hand-drawn illustrations over machine-learning-generated illustrations.</p>
