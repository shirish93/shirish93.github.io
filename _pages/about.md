<p>Hi, I'm Shirish Pokharel!
</p>
<p>
I go by 'Shirish' which is pronounced Si-Reash. My last name is pronounced Pokharel -- Poe-Kh-Rael.
</p>
<p>
As of March 2024 I work as an Innovation Engineer at Solaria Labs. I enjoy working here, with smart, talented, and caring coworkers.

Before Solaria, I was at a business automation startup in Downtown Boston.
<p></p>
Before that, I was a Master's student at UMass-Amherst in the Computer Science Department. My field of specialization was Secure Distributed Systems, and security in Machine Learning models.
