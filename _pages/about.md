<p>Hi, I'm Shirish Pokharel!
</p>
<p>
I go by 'Shirish' which is pronounced Si-Reash. My last name is pronounced Pokharel -- Poe-Kh-Rael.
</p>
<p>
As of March 2024 I work as an Innovation Engineer at Solaria Labs. I enjoy working here, with smart, talented, and caring coworkers.
</p><p>
I've done some pretty terrible standup comedy performances and am quite bad at the Driving Range, but I keep trying, much like the spider in the King Robert Bruce tale.
</p>
<p>
I am an amateur novelist, and have been known to work concurrently on several novels. I have ~60,000 in my longest draft. It's pretty bad.
</p><p>
I like fermenting things. I have made hundreds of batches of kombucha, kefir, and so on, the list of my ferments is too long to list. Go to <a href="shirish.me">this will be a working link in the future</a> to read more on the brews I have worked on. GO to <a href="shirish.me">this will be a working link in the future</a> if you want to get a sense of what I&#39;ll be working on next
</p>
<p>I am an amateur food scientist, and have done non-fermenting food preservation projects too. I have dehydrated enough fruits and vegetables, and powdered them to feed a small, highly mobile army with boring food habits. Turning fruits and vegetables into edible chips is fun, though not as healthy as one might hope, it turns out... I also have a tiny hydroponics system in my apartment to grow off-season veggies and give a boost to my houseplants, and I grow mushrooms indoors on a semi-regular basis. I&#39;m a due-paying, card-carrying member of <a href="https://www.psms.org/">Puget Sound Mycological Society</a> and <a href="https://pugetsoundbees.org/">Puget Sound Beekeeper&#39;s Association</a>. </p>
<p>
I enjoy doing research on hindu myths and traditions, and the historical arts, sciences and technology in the South Asian subcontinent.
</p><p>
I like to bike, and my trusty cheapo folding bike was my dear friend between 2015-2020. It got me out of several tricky situations, like walk besides the state highway in NH to commute to work. I have unfortunately not been able to bike recently after moving to Seattle. I live on the top of a steep hill, with four floors to climb to get in my apartment...

<h5>About Me</h5>

<p> I'm currently working as a Senior Innovation Engineer at  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.solarialabs.com">Solaria Labs</a>. I'm based in Seattle and believe the Pacific Northwest is heaven on Earth. I went to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cics.umass.edu">Amherst UMass</a> for college and grad school. A few of the small businesses I have founded have succeeded, and others have floundered and failed. I was an organizer of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/6545">TEDx events</a> two years in a row.</p>
