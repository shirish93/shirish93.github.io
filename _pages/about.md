<p>Hi, I'm Shirish Pokharel!</p>

<p>I go by 'Shirish' which is pronounced Si-Reash. My last name is pronounced Pokharel -- Poe-Kh-Rael.</p>

<p>As of September 2024 I work as an Senior Innovation Engineer at Solaria Labs. I enjoy working here, with smart, talented, and caring coworkers.</p>

<p>This website is about 80% complete. Some pages are still being edited, content is being added, and some features are on the buggier side. Check out the search bar on the top right to see a slightly buggy implementation of in-page search!</p>

<p> Here are some fun facts about me. I'm building out this website to be of higher professional standards over the coming weeks and months, so enjoy this bit of trivia! </p> If you think this stuff is all rather silly, I disagree! Read <a href="https://www.shirish.me/diverse-hobbies">this post</a> I wrote for a retort.
<ul>
<li>My stand-up comedy skills are just as good as my skills at the driving range. Absolutely terrible. I love them anyway.</li>
<li>I am an amateur novelist. My longest draft is a whopping 60,000 words (and yes, it's just. so. bad.)</li>
<li>I'm a fermentation enthusiast. I've brewed countless batches of kombucha, kefir, and more. Check out shirish.me/fermentland (unpublished at the moment) to see what I've been up to and what's next.</li>
<li>I'm an amateur food scientist. I've dabbled in non-fermentation food preservation. I've dehydrated and powdered enough fruits and veggies to feed a small army (though maybe not a very healthy one!). More lately, I'm using dried herbs, flowers, fruits and roots to flavor my ferments.</li>
<li>I grow things. I have a hydroponics system for off-season veggies and houseplants. I'm also a proud indoor mushroom cultivator. I'm a dues-paying member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society (https://www.psms.org/) and the Puget Sound Beekeeper's Association (https://pugetsoundbees.org/).</li>
<li>I'm a mythology buff. I love reading on South Asian myths, culinary traditions, and the historical arts of South Asia. My dream vocation would be a full-time researcher of culinary histories of Nepal and Tibet</li>
<li>(Though currently on hold) I'm a biking enthusiast. My trusty folding bike was my partner-in-crime from 2015-2020, saving me from sticky situations (like walking next to a highway to commute!). Unfortunately, my current Seattle residence with its steep hill and four-flight climb isn't the most bike-friendly...</li>

<h5>About Me</h5>

<p> I'm currently working as a Senior Innovation Engineer at  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.solarialabs.com">Solaria Labs</a>. I'm based in Seattle and believe the Pacific Northwest is heaven on Earth. I went to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cics.umass.edu">Amherst UMass</a> for college and grad school. A few of the small businesses I have founded have succeeded, and others have floundered and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shirish.me/failed-projects">failed</a>. I was an organizer of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/6545">TEDx events</a> two years in a row.</p>
