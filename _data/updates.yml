    <p>I survived the Enchantments thru-hike! It was quite a...hike...that kept going on and on for 16 hours. Here's my recorded logs from the trail:<br><br></p>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">3:23 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text">
        <p>After months of hoping that somebody else would chicken out before I did, and I wouldn't have to be the one to pull the plug on it, it has come to this. It's 3:20 in the morning. It's been 20 minutes since all of us woke up, and we're getting ready for the Enchantment hike. There's no backing out of it now. I am not prepared for this, but I have to do this. I have psyched myself into this project and, well, here it goes.</p>
        <p>Prabhat and Paras are in the kitchen already. They're getting their breakfast and getting ready. I've packed my lunch, which is tofu banh mi sandwiches from Saigon Deli. I'm 95% ready. We'll probably head out in five or seven minutes.</p>
        <p>Someone flew all the way from Washington D.C. to do this, so this is an exciting moment. I haven't actively been planning for it or trained for it, so we'll see how that goes. Breakfast was PB&J sandwiches and croissants from Costco.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">3:45 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text">
        <p>It's 3:45, and we're probably five or seven minutes away from leaving. We're not really running behind time because, in the order of a 15-17 hour hike, 15-25 minutes is not that big of a margin to be worried about.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">3:55 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 3:55, and we're leaving now.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">4:30 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 4:30 in the morning, and we're at the parking spot. We're gonna start our hike in five minutes. It's so dark and a bit cold, but it feels manageable now.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">4:38 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 4:38 in the morning, and we've pretty much started. Abe and Paras are filling out the forms. There's a river behind us. We walked maybe 50-100 feet, and I felt so tired. So there are only 24-25 miles to go. Yeah, it's going to be fun.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">6:01 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text">
        <p>It's six in the morning, and I just used the restroom on the trail. This was legitimately the best trail restroom I've ever used. Zero smell. The seat was extraordinarily comfortable. In fact, this random toilet seat in the middle of nature on top of a ditch was better than 80% of the restrooms I find in public places in Nepal. This is really quite good. I'm very impressed.</p>
        <p>We are an hour and a half-ish from our start. I don't think we've covered much ground, but that should be okay because most people also account for their morning routine and so forth in the 12 to 14 hours of hike time. We're probably on the slower side of the average pace, but we're doing really good.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">7:19 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>We're at Lake Colchuck. It's 7:19. I am surprisingly exhausted. I don't feel like my full self. I think maybe it's the electrolytes or something else. I'm running through water surprisingly fast. I think I want to rest here for 10 minutes and then will be re-energized. The lake is pretty nice.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">8:43 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 8:45 AM, and now we're doing the intense Aasgard Pass scramble. I'm sitting and resting with Prabhat. Abe and Paras have climbed a little higher. It's really, really exhausting, and my thighs are giving out already. We're only about 20% into this intense climb. And the "good part" is that there are nine additional hours of non-stop downhill. I'm going to be so freaking relieved when this intense hike is over. Prabhat wants to be done with the scramble by 11 AM. Fingers crossed, we'll be able to do it, but I don't know for sure.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">9:49 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 9:50 in the morning. We are 70% of our way to the end of Aasgard pass. We can see a ton of mountains; we're really, really high up. Prabhat and I still struggling to climb as the rest of the gang still continues to abandon us. It's really pretty from here. And now that we've made it so far, the remaining 30% feels a lot more manageable. My knees have started hurting, so I imagine I'll get chronic knee pain for the next couple of weeks after we're done with this. My leg was trembling earlier, but we're all set.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">11:13 AM</span>
      <div class="log-text">
        <p>It's 11:13, and I'm at the peak. We met up with Abe and Paras a little earlier. Turns out they had taken a different route. The peak is pretty sweet. One of my calves and one of my thighs are gone, so I'll be limping my way down. I don't feel very tired or exhausted.</p>
        <p>It's been quite an adventure. We helped rescue a person who was stuck in loose gravel, and she was really, really afraid. I also needed to be pulled up with my pole because I was also in loose gravel. Different groups took different trails to get here, so there was some confusion earlier. But it's been a pretty decent hike. The way down may be a lot more miserable. I'm hearing that the first five miles downhill are all boulders and gravel, so that does not bode well for my legs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">1:15 PM</span>
      <div class="log-text"><p>It's 1:13. I'm recording a lot less because I'm getting very tired. The downward hike has been pretty uneventful and it's been manageable up to this point. We're rapidly running out of water, but we're planning on using a filter in the next lake or so, Lake Vivian. Besides my right knee hurting super duper bad, things are pretty good. People have a good energy level.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry">
      <span class="log-time">8:44 PM</span>
      <div class="log-text">
        <p>It's 8:45. We completed the hike at 8:40. Barring some small issues here and there, I think overall the hike was pretty successful. None of us got seriously hurt or anything. My knee going out of action was kind of a pre-existing condition, so you can't really blame the hike. I had brought my knee brace because I was anticipating the knee issue. I was expecting to be a lot more miserable than I am now, so it's a win. I did take like three doses of painkillers, and that's significantly helped my journey.</p>
        <p>Everybody's tired as hell. I got about 10 or 12 minutes of recording, and I missed like the six or seven crucial hours because I was too exhausted and hurting. All right, I think that's it for today</p>

    So many genAI-related blog posts on this site, it's getting a bit repetitive. Gonna take up a more interesting theme in the Fall. I also want to write about topics that have not fully-saturated everybody's consciousness. People start zoning out of a topic after a while if they're engaged in it too much...

    I really gotta try to make this page look nicer. It looks outdated and janky even for early 90's. It's all handcrafted and 'made with love', but maybe machines can be relied on for _some_ things...

    Did two 12-mile hikes over the weekend. It was an incredibly tiring but rewarding experience. I gave up about 7 times on my way up the Mailbox Peak on Sunday. I eventually made it. Thinking I should write something about that.
    Quite excited about the upcoming Enchantments hike on labor day weekend! It's going to be 25+ miles of tough terrain in 16-ish hours. It's been long time in the making, this is the time to get that checked off.

    My first Mac computer is here! With 64 gigs of (video) RAM, I'll be able to run advanced genAI models locally. I've setup Obsidian editor to help me write, and Ollama local application to run the models. Silly thing about Obsidian is, it won't show the file needed to update this page for some reason...
    Actually, nevermind. Just realized Obsidian can only 'see' markdown files. Still need VSCodium for site editing then. I wish they would change their logo/icon. It gives me 'mold gone wrong' vibe for some reason. And I say that as somebody who loves mold cultures and solid-state fermentation...

    Recently returned from a 'working vacation' in Virginia. Felt great catching up with friends and family after 18(!) months -- the longest I've gone without visiting the state. Fantastic eateries too. Thinking I should start a more personal 'reviews' section on this website as personal blog...

    Visiting Atlanta after 11 years, and the changes in Midtown area are incredible. Spent quality time at a Dancing Goat Cafe (excellent), and a brilliant, authentic Persian restaurant. Atlanta is truly the center of food and music. Two days in town, and I've had a better foodie experience than 4 years in Seattle.
    Also quite fortunate to find myself in the MLK Jr. museum right on MLK Jr day! It was completely unplanned, and I became aware only a few days ago.
    This town's never disappointed me, that is for sure!

    I've been attending Seattle City Council's public hearings lately. The more I learn about local politics, the more I understand how captured it is. The lack of engagement in local politics has allowed time and resource-rich entities to capture democracy. It's not a matter of political parties, it's a total and complete power capture. I hope to inspire many folks to get more engaged in local politics.

    Dan Dennett, my longtime professor and onetime mentor has passed away. He was the leading philosopher of our time, and it was my absolute privilege to have taken seven (!) courses with him, even after graduating from Tufts where he taught for many decades. Last time I talked to him was when I was unofficially enrolled in his course in early 2020.
    Dan was a one-of-a-kind thinker and communicator of the highest order, and his excitement towards consciousness studies and cognitive science was infectious.
    Dan's body may be gone, but the body of work he's left behind, and the ideas he has imprinted upon humanity, they will be around for avery long time. We will miss you Dan!

    Spent 30 minutes with the research librarian at the central branch of Seattle Public Library. Learned about academic research and requested guidance on further information about traditional foods of different ethnicities in Nepal. I'm excited!

    TEST. This is also a test message, where I'm definining date, image and location. It validates that myrudimentary implementation of 'social updates' feature done through yaml files has been a success. 
    Also, this shows that I can post long multi-line, multiparagraph messages...

    TEST. This is a test message, it has no metadata attached to it, and all of the variables are pre-poopulated defaults. Looks alright to me?
