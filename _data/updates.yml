    I really gotta try to make this page look nicer. It looks outdated and janky even for early 90's. It's all handcrafted and 'made with love', but maybe machines can be relied on for _some_ things...

    Did two 12-mile hikes over the weekend. It was an incredibly tiring but rewarding experience. I gave up about 7 times on my way up the Mailbox Peak on Sunday. I eventually made it. Thinking I should write something about that.
    Quite excited about the upcoming Enchantments hike on labor day weekend! It's going to be 25+ miles of tough terrain in 16-ish hours. It's been long time in the making, this is the time to get that checked off.

    My first Mac computer is here! With 64 gigs of (video) RAM, I'll be able to run advanced genAI models locally. I've setup Obsidian editor to help me write, and Ollama local application to run the models. Silly thing about Obsidian is, it won't show the file needed to update this page for some reason...
    Actually, nevermind. Just realized Obsidian can only 'see' markdown files. Still need VSCodium for site editing then. I wish they would change their logo/icon. It gives me 'mold gone wrong' vibe for some reason. And I say that as somebody who loves mold cultures and solid-state fermentation...

    Recently returned from a 'working vacation' in Virginia. Felt great catching up with friends and family after 18(!) months -- the longest I've gone without visiting the state. Fantastic eateries too. Thinking I should start a more personal 'reviews' section on this website as personal blog...

    Visiting Atlanta after 11 years, and the changes in Midtown area are incredible. Spent quality time at a Dancing Goat Cafe (excellent), and a brilliant, authentic Persian restaurant. Atlanta is truly the center of food and music. Two days in town, and I've had a better foodie experience than 4 years in Seattle.
    Also quite fortunate to find myself in the MLK Jr. museum right on MLK Jr day! It was completely unplanned, and I became aware only a few days ago.
    This town's never disappointed me, that is for sure!

    I've been attending Seattle City Council's public hearings lately. The more I learn about local politics, the more I understand how captured it is. The lack of engagement in local politics has allowed time and resource-rich entities to capture democracy. It's not a matter of political parties, it's a total and complete power capture. I hope to inspire many folks to get more engaged in local politics.

    Dan Dennett, my longtime professor and onetime mentor has passed away. He was the leading philosopher of our time, and it was my absolute privilege to have taken seven (!) courses with him, even after graduating from Tufts where he taught for many decades. Last time I talked to him was when I was unofficially enrolled in his course in early 2020.
    Dan was a one-of-a-kind thinker and communicator of the highest order, and his excitement towards consciousness studies and cognitive science was infectious.
    Dan's body may be gone, but the body of work he's left behind, and the ideas he has imprinted upon humanity, they will be around for avery long time. We will miss you Dan!

    Spent 30 minutes with the research librarian at the central branch of Seattle Public Library. Learned about academic research and requested guidance on further information about traditional foods of different ethnicities in Nepal. I'm excited!

    TEST. This is also a test message, where I'm definining date, image and location. It validates that myrudimentary implementation of 'social updates' feature done through yaml files has been a success. 
    Also, this shows that I can post long multi-line, multiparagraph messages...

    TEST. This is a test message, it has no metadata attached to it, and all of the variables are pre-poopulated defaults. Looks alright to me?
