    I've been attending Seattle City Council's public hearings lately. The more I learn about local politics, the more I understand how captured it is. The lack of engagement in local politics has allowed time and resource-rich entities to capture democracy. It's not a matter of political parties, it's a total and complete power capture. I hope to inspire many folks to get more engaged in local politics.

    Dan Dennett, my longtime professor and onetime mentor has passed away. He was the leading philosopher of our time, and it was my absolute privilege to have taken seven (!) courses with him, even after graduating from Tufts where he taught for many decades. Last time I talked to him was when I was unofficially enrolled in his course in early 2020.
    Dan was a one-of-a-kind thinker and communicator of the highest order, and his excitement towards consciousness studies and cognitive science was infectious.
    Dan's body may be gone, but the body of work he's left behind, and the ideas he has imprinted upon humanity, they will be around for a very very long time. We will miss you Dan!

    Spent 30 minutes with the research librarian at the central branch of Seattle Public Library. Learned about academic research and requested guidance on further information about traditional foods of various ethnicities in Nepal. I'm excited!

    TEST. This is also a test message, where I'm definining date, image and location. It validates that my very rudimentary implementation of 'social updates' feature done through yaml files has been a success. 
    Also, this shows that I can post long multi-line, multiparagraph messages...

    TEST. This is a test message, it has no metadata attached to it, and all of the variables are pre-poopulated defaults. Looks alright to me?
