    This is also a test message, where I'm definining date, image and location. It validates that my very rudimentary implementation of 'social updates' feature done through yaml files has been a success. I can edit yaml files and succeed. Next goal is to use thumbnail versions of the attached images instead of full-strength ones, and link them to the main version. But that's for a later day. 

    Also, this shows that I can post long multi-line, multiparagraph messages...

    This is a test message, it has no metadata attached to it, and all of the variables are pre-poopulated defaults. Looks alright to me? The posted date will look a bit strange, but that's a price we're willing to pay.
