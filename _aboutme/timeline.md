Hi I'm Shirish and this timeline charts the experiences, both grand and tiny, that have shaped who I am today.

**2008: Big Interviews, Big Troubles:** As student reporter, I interviewed two of Nepal's most prominent figures: the Prime Minister and the President. I was horrified to discover that my compliment to the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girija_Prasad_Koirala) on writing an autobiography "nobody's as big as you" was likely misinterpreted, as he was famously tall. Ahh youthful naivety.

**2010-2011: Sparking Innovation at TEDx:** The power of ideas and the energy of connection fueled my passion for TEDx events. My friend and I co-organized TEDxKathmandu events two years in a row.

**2011: Taking the Stage (and the Reviews) in Stride:** I played a key role in Edward Albee's "Ballard of the Sad Cafe." While the reviews weren't stellar ("Best part? When the power went out"), the experience remains a bold chapter in my story. Ahhh Hollywood Dreams!

Gave a long Barcamp presentation on a Nepali film posters, I'd been collecting them for half-decade at this point. [(https://prezi.com/xtigclcjiuc5/nepali-film-posters/)]

**2009-2011: A Near-Miss with Educational Tech:** Innovation beckoned! My friend and I campagined strongly for the OLPC project, a well-intentioned (and thankfully) rejected attempt to revolutionize Kathmandu's education system. ([link to the idea])

**2012: A Scorching Summer of Learning in India:** The scorching Indian summer provided a vivid backdrop for research with a consultant group working for MIT Mobility lab. Exploring five Indian cities alongside the Jaipur Foot project offered invaluable insights. (We all needed a cool drink after that!)  Additionally, a weeklong residency with a prominent Indian venture capital firm leader further fueled my interest in entrepreneurship.

**2013: Immersing Myself in Ghan:** Seven transformative months in Ghana as a study-abroad student. My internship at the University of Ghana Accra's Ethno-musicology department deepened my appreciation for the rich West African musical tradition.

**2014: Sky-high Internship:** A Boston-based tech investment firm internship led to being interviewed and hired by the firm's current MD. He also mentored me career-wise in my early career.

**2016-2017: Masters in Warp Speed:** A two-year Master's program in Computer Science completed at UMass-Amherst in a mere 14 months! All of that, without a drop of caffeine!

**2017 (and Beyond): The Art of Fermentation:** Started my fermentation hobby and a passion for experimentation, which continues to this day.  Dive into my ongoing fermentation projects! ([link to projects])

**2018: Interviewing for the Unexpected**

The interview circuit took some unexpected turns.  Two separate interviews led to bosses who became a close associate of the British Prime Minister and a U.S. Congressman, respectively. Small world!

**2020: A Pivotal Year:** A trip to Nepal and Singapore just before the world changed. In the uncertainties and confusion of early-covid times, I decided to shift towards writing more professional essays, some of which you can find here.

**2022 and Beyond: Perpetual Learning:** The pursuit of knowledge never ends!  Currently enrolled in the Certificate in Engineering Leadership program at UW-Seattle.  Additionally, exploring creative pursuits with various art, dance, and crafts courses at Seattle Central College, making it my sixth university/college experience!
