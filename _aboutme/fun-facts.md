<p> Here are some fun facts about me. I'm building out this website to be of higher professional standards over the coming weeks and months, so enjoy this bit of trivia! </p> If you think this stuff is all rather silly, I disagree! Read <a href="https://www.shirish.me/diverse-hobbies">this post</a> I wrote for a retort.


* **Hack.Diversity Mentor:**  I've been a mentor for [Hack.Diversity](https://www.hackdiversity.com/) for five years running! [link to mentorship page, still a work in progress...]  Looking forward to many more years of helping others on their tech careers.

* **Student forever:** I've been a student or a visiting student at SIX different universities and colleges across the globe. There's always something new to learn. I'm taking classes at University of Washington - Seattle, and Seattle Central Community College right now. So many `.edu` email ids!

**Humblebrag Connections [FEEL FREE TO SKIP!]:** A billionaire and a close confidant to the (former) British Prime Minister, a U.S. Congressman, and a Managing Director of one of the most prestigious private equity investors in the U.S. What do they all have in common? They have all interviewed me for various jobs, and then hired me for the position! If you would like to be in their company by hiring me (or interview me to validate your theory that successful people make poor decisions all the time!) email me at <a href="mailto:hired@shirish.me">hired@shirish.me</a>.

* **Seattle Weather Fan:**  Yes, I said it! Three years strong in the Pacific NorthWest, and I'm loving the beauty, nature, and (dare I say) the weather! Seattle summers are pretty close to perfect heaven. I love the winters too.

* **TEDx Organizer:**  Co-organizing two TEDx events was an amazing -- and occasionally stressful -- experience. Wrangling VIPs and training them to present on a given format is more of a challenge than one would imagine.

* **(Aspiring) Food & Culture Historian :**  I have found my life's calling. I aspire to become a full-time researcher exploring the rich and delicious food culture of Tibet and Nepal. Until then, I'm happy with my chosen vocation.

<ul>
<li>My stand-up comedy skills are just as good as my skills at the driving range. Absolutely terrible. I love them anyway.</li>
<li>I am an amateur novelist. My longest draft is a whopping 60,000 words (and yes, it's just. so. bad.)</li>
<li>I'm a fermentation enthusiast. I've brewed countless batches of kombucha, kefir, and more. Check out shirish.me/fermentland (unpublished at the moment) to see what I've been up to and what's next.</li>
<li>I'm an amateur food scientist. I've dabbled in non-fermentation food preservation. I've dehydrated and powdered enough fruits and veggies to feed a small army (though maybe not a very healthy one!). More lately, I'm using dried herbs, flowers, fruits and roots to flavor my ferments.</li>
<li>I grow things. I have a hydroponics system for off-season veggies and houseplants. I'm also a proud indoor mushroom cultivator. I'm a dues-paying member of the Puget Sound Mycological Society (https://www.psms.org/) and the Puget Sound Beekeeper's Association (https://pugetsoundbees.org/).</li>
<li>I'm a mythology buff. I love reading on South Asian myths, culinary traditions, and the historical arts of South Asia. My dream vocation would be a full-time researcher of culinary histories of Nepal and Tibet</li>
<li>(Though currently on hold) I'm a biking enthusiast. My trusty folding bike was my partner-in-crime from 2015-2020, saving me from sticky situations (like walking next to a highway to commute!). Unfortunately, my current Seattle residence with its steep hill and four-flight climb isn't the most bike-friendly...</li>
