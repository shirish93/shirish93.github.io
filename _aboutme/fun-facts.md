Here you'll find my interests and hobbies, and exciting things I've done in the past. And a little bit of humblebrag, if I may!

* **Hack.Diversity Mentor:**  I've been a mentor for [Hack.Diversity](https://www.hackdiversity.com/) for five years running! [link to mentorship page, still a work in progress...]  Looking forward to many more years of helping others on their tech careers.

* **Student forever:** I've been a student or a visiting student at SIX different universities and colleges across the globe. There's always something new to learn. I'm taking classes at University of Washington - Seattle, and Seattle Central Community College right now. So many `.edu` email ids!

**Humblebrag Connections [FEEL FREE TO SKIP!]:** A billionaire and a close confidant to the (former) British Prime Minister, a U.S. Congressman, and a Managing Director of one of the most prestigious private equity investors in the U.S. What do they all have in common? They have all interviewed me for various jobs, and then hired me for the position! If you would like to be in their company by hiring me (or interview me to validate your theory that successful people make poor decisions all the time!) email me at <a href="mailto:hired@shirish.me">hired@shirish.me</a>.

* **Seattle Weather Fan:**  Yes, I said it! Three years strong in the Pacific NorthWest, and I'm loving the beauty, nature, and (dare I say) the weather! Seattle summers are pretty close to perfect heaven. I love the winters too.

* **TEDx Organizer:**  Co-organizing two TEDx events was an amazing -- and occasionally stressful -- experience. Wrangling VIPs and training them to present on a given format is more of a challenge than one would imagine.

* **(Aspiring) Food & Culture Historian :**  I have found my life's calling. I aspire to become a full-time researcher exploring the rich and delicious food culture of Tibet and Nepal. Until then, I'm happy with my chosen vocation.
