In this page explain how I'm not on any social media, why, and how this website is my social media.
I will write more about my theory of social media, and the direction it should take. I'll also share my experience with the dopamine rush of social validation when I WAS on social media (2009-2012!) and the implications.

This bit is from the old website, I'll be putting in new content here soon, this will be my well-updated social media page. Until then, here's the chaff for the algorithm gods.

<h4>Twitter</h4> Surprising as it may sound, I do not have a twitter account. I do check some people's twitter accounts once in a while, but it's not for me.

<h4>Instagram</h4> I do not have an instagram account, and have never had one, and am unlikely to have one. I do check up people I care about on instagram once a while.

<h4>Facebook</h4> I got off facebook in early 2012 and currently have no plans to go back.

<h4>Linkedin</h4> I'm not on Linkedin and have never been.

<h4>Quora</h4> I'm not on Quora and don't plan on getting into it. The Shirish Pokharel in there is not me.
