I am currently writing an essay explaining why I'm not on social media, and how this website is my social media. There I discuss my understanding of social media and connectivity, and the direction it should take. I also share my experience with social media and the dopamine rush with social validation when I used Facebook (2009-2012!) and the implications of that. Until then, there's' this.

To keep updated on my social media posts, go [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _aboutme/now.md %}).

<h4>Twitter</h4> Surprising as it may sound, I do not have a twitter account. I do check some people's twitter accounts once in a while, but it's not for me.

<h4>Instagram</h4> I do not have an instagram account, and have never had one, and am unlikely to have one. I do check up people I care about on instagram once a while.

<h4>Facebook</h4> I got off facebook in early 2012 and currently have no plans to go back.

<h4>Linkedin</h4> I'm not on Linkedin and have never been.

<h4>Quora</h4> I'm not on Quora and don't plan on getting into it. The Shirish Pokharel in there is not me.
