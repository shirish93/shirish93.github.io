##  LINK TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA PAGE ABOUT HOW I'M NOT ON ANY. OR MAYBE THIS SHOULD GO TO THAT PAGE?


<p>
This bit is from the old website, I'll be putting in new content here soon, this will be my well-updated social media page. Until then, here's the chaff for the algorithm gods.
</p>
<h4>Twitter</h4> Surprising as it may sound, I do not have a twitter account. I do check some people's twitter accounts once in a while, but it's not for me.
<br>
<h4>Instagram</h4> I do not have an instagram account, and have never had one, and am unlikely to have one. I do check up people I care about on instagram once a while.
<br>
<h4>Facebook</h4> I got off facebook in early 2012 and currently have no plans to go back.
<br>
<h4>Linkedin</h4> I'm not on Linkedin and have never been.
<br>
<h4>Quora</h4> I'm not on Quora and don't plan on getting into it. The Shirish Pokharel in there is not me.

explain how I'm not on any social media, why, and how this website is my social media.
