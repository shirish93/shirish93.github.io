A proud hack.diversity engineering mentor five years in a row. "Five years Jeremy, five, that's too many!"[link to the meme] Looking forward to five more years!

I like Seattle for its beautiful weather. There, I said it. Four years in the PNW, and it's just the beginning of this journey!
My current favourite hobby is gel printing. The trick, I've learned, is to wait for the agar plates to set and not eat them like a jelly candy.
Not to overstate my case, but Seattle & the PNW in Summer gets as close to heaven as is possible.
As a co-organizer of two TEDx events, I can say this with great authority: organizing large events is hard, man, specially when it involves important(TM) people.

My life's ultimate calling would be to become a full-time historian of food and culture in Tibet and Nepal. Barring that, whatever I'm doing right now.
That 'party-size' bag of Doritos I've been known to finish in one sitting is like social media to me. It ain't good for you, but nobody's making it illegal!

I am having so much fun, I'll work on it for 30 more minutes, rest is for the weak, goes the calling cry of the person who burnt themselves out having fun.

A billionaire and a close confidant to the British Prime Minister, a sitting U.S. Congressman, and an MD of one of the most prestigious private equity tech investors in the country. What do they all have in common? They all interviewed me for jobs, and then hired me! If you would like to be in their company by hiring me(or interview me to validate your theory that successful people make poor decisions all the time!) email me at <a href="mailto:hired@shirish.me">hired@shirish.me</a>.
