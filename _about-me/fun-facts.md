* **Hack.Diversity Mentor:**  A proud mentor for Hack.Diversity for five years running!  [link to mentorship page]  Looking forward to many more years of helping others on their tech journeys.

* **Life-Long Learner:** I've donned the hats of student and researcher at six different universities and colleges across the globe. There's always something new to discover!

* **Seattle Sunshine Fan:**  Yes, I said it! Three years strong in the PNW, and I'm loving the beauty, nature, and (dare I say) the weather! Seattle summers are pretty darn close to perfect heaven!

* **Gel Printing Guru:**  My current artistic obsession is gel printing.  Top tip: patience is key!  Let the agar plates set before indulging (they're not candy!).

* **TEDx Organizer:**  Co-organizing two TEDx events was an amazing (and occasionally stressful) experience.  Let's just say wrangling VIPs is a challenge!

* **Food & Culture Historian (Aspiring):**  My ultimate life goal: To become a full-time historian exploring the delicious food and rich culture of Tibet and Nepal. Until then, I'm happy with my chosen vocation.

* **Rest is for the Weary:**  "Rest is for the weak" is a motto I try NOT to live by.  Balance is key, even for those who love having fun! 

* **Get in Touch:**  Interested in working together?  Shoot me an email at [your email address].

**Humblebrag Connections [FEEL FREE TO IGNORE!]:** A billionaire and a close confidant to the British Prime Minister, a U.S. Congressman, and an MD of one of the most prestigious private equity investors in the U.S. What do they all have in common? They have all interviewed me for various jobs, and then hired me for the position! If you would like to be in their company by hiring me(or interview me to validate your theory that successful people make poor decisions all the time!) email me at <a href="mailto:hired@shirish.me">hired@shirish.me</a>.
