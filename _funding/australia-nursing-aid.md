austrailia manche lai pathaune  - I will provide seed funding to people who implement this. 50-50 percent match with consultancy. Contract for receivers to support the cause once this starts working again.
    * What exactly is my ask?
    * What credentials/experience do the applicants need to have to get the funding?
    * What will be the deliverable? What is the minimal product I will be happy to provide the funding for?
    * What are the growth opportunities? Where would the project go once my funding ran out, ideally? What would the final form look like?
    * How much money am I willing to invest? Is this charity, is this equity investment, is this research grant, is this a loan? Is this partnership?
