**About the Scholarship Program**

Our goal is to provide scholarships to talented and ambitious female students, enabling them to access the best educational opportunities offered by Australian colleges and universities. The scholarship will cover a significant portion of the recipient's tuition fees (amount: $[X] USD) and will be awarded based on academic merit and financial need.

* **Immigration Compliance:** Ensure all aspects of the program adhere to relevant Australian immigration laws and regulations.
* **Communication Bridge:** Facilitate communication between us and the scholarship recipients throughout the application journey.
* **Ongoing Support:** (Optional) Offer additional services, such as visa renewal assistance, accommodation arrangements, and academic support (subject to negotiation).

**Next Steps**

If you are a reputable immigration consultancy with a proven track record and a commitment to social impact, we encourage you to submit a proposal outlining your approach to this partnership. We look forward to collaborating with a dedicated partner who shares our vision of supporting and empowering young women through the transformative power of education.

**Funding amount and details**

The exact amount of funding and the expectations from you to match can be flexible. We are open to negotiating a larger sum based on your efficacy and efficiency, and are willing to fundraise more from our partners to expand the program if you so wish.

**Please note:**  

* This is a charitable program focused on creating positive social impact.
* Funding for the immigration consultancy will be based on a proposal review process.

We believe that with your expertise and our resources, we can create a lasting impact on the lives of deserving young women. We look forward to hearing from you!

### Points for further consideration
    
* **Project Sustainability**: Ideally we want the receipients who have participated in the program to contribute back to the program once they have reached Australia and are earning, so we can offer this to an increasing number of women. However, we understand that might not be strictly possible, or implementable, so open to hearing alternative proposals.
