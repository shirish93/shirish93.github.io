culture - I will provide seed funding to somebody who is working on documenting cultural identity of ethnic groups iin Nepal. Hmmm maybe this isn't as important for the time being...
    * What exactly is my ask?
    * What credentials/experience do the applicants need to have to get the funding?
    * What will be the deliverable? What is the minimal product I will be happy to provide the funding for?
    * What are the growth opportunities? Where would the project go once my funding ran out, ideally? What would the final form look like?
    * How much money am I willing to invest? Is this charity, is this equity investment, is this research grant, is this a loan? Is this partnership?
