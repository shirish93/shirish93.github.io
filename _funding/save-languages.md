Language - Save our languages! Offer language courses, digitize dictionaries, youtube videos in those languages with Nepali/English subtitles. What are the possibilities here!
* What exactly is my ask?
* What credentials/experience do the applicants need to have to get the funding?
* What will be the deliverable? What is the minimal product I will be happy to provide the funding for?
* What are the growth opportunities? Where would the project go once my funding ran out, ideally? What would the final form look like?
* How much money am I willing to invest? Is this charity, is this equity investment, is this research grant, is this a loan? Is this partnership?
