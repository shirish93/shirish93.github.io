Indian / South Asian drink, fermented carrots and mustard seeds with optional added sugar, traditionally a bit fizzy and done in the summer, need warm temperature, the sort of Indian Spring / Summer. 
* I tried but it failed miserably, didn't getfar. The yeasts on the veggie surface are supposed to ferment the sugars in water medium, the mustard seeds supposed to fight other pathogens to buddy up with the natural yeasts
* but it took forever, didn't have consistent performance. 
* In india bottles, containers left out in the sun, possible the pathogens are also killed by the UV rays of sunlight (disinfecting power of sunlight),
* but since I was not doing that, didn't work out. 
* Tried twice since, and the results have been mediocre. 
* Have used carrots once again in water kefir ferments, wondering now if people actually use a starter culture to begin because with an existing culture, carrot is a rapid enabler, without them it's always been super slow for me, maybe sunlight does play a more important role than otherwise?
* Carrots are amazing source of easy nitrogen for ferments!
