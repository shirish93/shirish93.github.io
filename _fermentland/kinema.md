* Fermented soy product of South Asia, Limbu and other tribal groups in Eastern Nepal and north-eastern India. 
* Basic solid-state fermentation, cooked soybeans provided alkaline conditions and high humidity and left out in the air for several days. 
* Takes a bit funky smell and flavor, sticky, slimy texturesimilar to that of natto in Japan,similar ferments.
* Also takes on a deep earthy flavor, reminiscent of smoked cheese, and possibly slightly-off onion etcetera. 
* It's an acquired taste and flavor, outside the veggies has smell reminiscent of old socks of messy teenagers  
* consumed and distributed in dried form when the effect is a lot less intense, smells like funky cheese in dried form.
* When cooked, gives 'smoky' vibes...
* Consumed as vegetable curry and pickles, eaten with rice and corn products as a side dish.
* Used for base flavor with added strong other flavors to mask the powerful aroma.
* few solid-state basic nature ferment.  
* easy to do, important to not overuse in a dish. 
* Adds a complexity and depth to standard dishes that can be  impressive if the eater doesn't know what it is. 
* Connoisours of strong european cheeses, and japanese natto will specially find it to be yummy.
