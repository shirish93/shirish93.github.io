## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

Mixture of two of my ferments, already a tradition in Vietnam, compound one what good luck! Fermented rice grains with alcohol taken out, and fermented soybean (kinema, or tempeh) mixed together, brine solution added, moved twice daily and put out in the sun for 3 months in Vietnam. Nice'umami' sauce, salty. The vietnamese miso in a way, used as a dip or a rub, or a spicemuch in the sense of miso. A slightly funky smell. If not regularly stirred could take longer than 3 months. Enzyme amylase and microbes in the rice culture break soybeans, and soy microbes interact with rice. The brine solution to protect the ferment from external molds and other pathogens. Usually prefers higher temperaturees, 35C and higher.
      My discovery: if you aren't willing to stir twice daily, be prepared to spend a long time waiting for it to work, and no guarantee it'll work. The final result smells and tastes  unlike the initial raw ingredients. Need to make sure the rice is completely cooked otherwise it'll remain grainy in the final sauce, as I've experienced once.
