## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE


Milk kefir. Find the description online. Put the 'grains' of starter in cold milk, leave for 24-72, hours, longer means more sour. Milk can 'break' if for longer, but it's not 'spoiled', vigorous shaking will reconstitute the mixture. Can be flavored (with tea, juices, infusions), can be used for cooking, can be used to make tea, can be consumed like drinkable yogurt or buttermilk.  Grains will multiply and increase in volume
Temps: 1 day if temps higher than 80F. In colder temperatures can take up to 3 days to properly set. Longer = 'more solid' complete fermentation, no fear of lactose for the intolerants.
After fermentation is complete, can be added with sugar and put out for a day or two in tightly sealed container to make it sweet, sour and fizzy, refrigerating it after improves the flavor even more.
Milk kefir grains can also be used to ferment sugar + water after adding sugar and nitrogen source, like carrot.
TO increase the biomass of the kefir 'grains', add whey protein + airate the mixture using bubblers.
