## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

What is water kefir? is it kefir at all? TIbicos. Took me long time to figure out. Needs sugar water, mineral source, and nitrogen source. Mineral + nitrogen source can  be fruit juices or veggies, such as carrots or potatoes.
Recipe: sugar solution + nitrogen source (juice, or carrot pieces) + water + starter grains, can leave between 24-48 hours to a few weeks depending on the weather and the level of sourness desired, you decide when it's done! Grains will multiply and increase in volume
Can also do flavoring round after first, take out the grains, put fruit juice or flavoring and let ferment for a few days. Secondary fermentation is optional, add priming sugar and put it in air-tight containers, leaving a good airspace. Need to be careful, one of my vigorous ferments!
Drunk sour like soda (carbonated or not), or mixed with fruit juices and other drinks.
Ferment can be slow to get started, think does it have good carbon source (sugar) and source for nitrogen and minerals? Needs mixed nutrition like humans!
Sometimes 'pellicle' can form on top of the surface of water, is normal, not to worry about, scoby creating protective film to protect itself, can be discarded or kept around. Don't worry about using metal objects during processing, no big deal.
