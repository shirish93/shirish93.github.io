#### What they are, how they are used, when they need to be used, alternatives etc.
* ~10 wide-top food-safe gallon jars
* air bubbler to help 'weak' ferments with oxygenation
* heating pad and temperature controller, often used for heading seedlings
* 'food warm bag', to maintain consistent temps. I double them up for double double insulation.
* nice funnel(s), sieve, cheesecloth etc.
* dozens of starter cultures, molds, etc.
* oven is the best place to protect and continue ferments.
    - I use oven for general storage now, so other options are used.
