ADAPTIVE
* Using milk kefir for water kefir
    * Using kefir and kombucha combined
    * rice fermentation molds for millet etc.
    * kombucha adapted to take new sugars after so long.

HARDY
* really hard to destroy a ferment starter, trust me I've tried
* doesn't always work in your favor, because the ecosystem can adapt against your interest
    * Attempts to change them back to your liking could likely fail because they can be hardy!
