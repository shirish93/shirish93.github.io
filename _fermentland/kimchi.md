## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

Napa cabbage, daikon radish. Fermented vegetables in the Korean style. How is it different from sauerkraut? Using korean recipes, spices and methods. Done cabbage and radish, with pineapple added too. RUb salt on veggies, let them dehydrate, pack tightly with addition of certain addons like fish sauce, rice flour etc. Let ferment for a couple of days to a couple of weeks depending on season and expectation of taste. Does much better in the summer with temperatures higher than 60F, long fermentation time can be tricky because more chance for pathogens to spoil it. Need to be careful to either start with existing kimchi 'starter' or nothing. Started with kombucha starter for a batch, and the taste was off, it didn't taste like kimchi, it tasted like a tea ferment, fine if that's what you want, but not resembling actual kimchi. It's eaten with carbs, it can be used in things like fried rice, or eaten as side dish for rice, noodles, etc. Can be eaten raw, in sandwiches, salads, quite diverse usage!
