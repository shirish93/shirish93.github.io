#### What is it? 
I Used milk kefir grains to ferment sugar water and or juices, and checked the outcome. 
* Take spoonful of milk kefir grains, put in water, gradually dissolve mineral sugar (the big chunky one) over a couple of weeks. 
* Also add a protein source in form of some juice, or carrots or potato slices. 
* Grains will not multiply or increase in volume like water kefir, but it's okay they'll work. 
* They'll change their color as eventually adapting from pure milk ferments to compound ferments.
* Is consumed exactly like water kefir, can also be used for cooking but the taste is a little 'off', not great vinegar replacement.

#### Considerations
* Risk is the transfer might not work straight away and might need a couple of rounds of attempt to make the transition possible, have enough milk grain around.
* Think about the source for nutrients the culture needs, how you are getting it to them, and the fact that it'll be new to the new ecosystem, so be patient and let it settle down to new systems. 
* Once the culture is completely set, won't need the water to transfer the cultures, the 'grains' themselves will be sufficient, but again, they won't grow so they're precious.

* Might not even need the milk kefir grains, but that can get risky!
* Biofilm will develop in most 'nutritious' solutions left to nature.
