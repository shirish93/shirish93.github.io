* proper fruit wines haven't turned out the best.
* water kefir is always either overcarbonated or undercarbonated. Have eventually been figuring out what's up. The results are weird and unexpected!
    - nettle leaves as addons will make the ferment go crazy!
* pasturizing without losing the proper health profile and flavor and texture
* consistency / knowing what it might taste and feel like before going in
    - I've been really poor with consistency over the last 7 years, mostly still in experimental phase, but consistency increasing.
* aligning production cycle and consumption cycle
    - I ferment in big batches, but consumption doesn't happen that way. As a result, there's 'feast and famine' cycle of output vs consumption. If I can 'smoothen' the peaks and troughs, will be able to do quicker experiments, newer drinks, more explorations.
