## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

Ferment from Indonesia, soy-based, uses R ryzope (look it up online), makes solid structure out of soy grains. White mold-like structure, traditionally made inside banana leaves. Consumed in curry form, stew, fried, in sandwiches, and numerous other ways in Indonesia. Quickly arising in popularity in the states, great depth and 'umami', reasonable replacement for meat. Boil soybeans, add the starter culture, let it sit in high-humidity culture for a couple of days, before the mold spores start appearing. The grains will have congealed to a solid block. Cut into slices and store in the freezer. Generally higher temperature fermentation, 30-40C. Made it a few times, pretty decent, also had TJ's tempeh, mine wasn't as great, the initial moisture content of grains is very important, if they're too wet when starting, they don't congeal into a block and can't be cut, need to improve that.
