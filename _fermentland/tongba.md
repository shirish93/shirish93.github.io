* Made by the Limbu people in eastern Nepal, millet grains fermented by mold and amylase enzymes, plus yeast from the air. 
* Ferment it by boiling millet grains, adding mold starter after cooling and putting the mixture in a warm sport for couple of months.
* The more important and interesting part is the drinking process.
* Put in an aluminum or wooden container, hot water added, and drunk with a metal straw with one end bashed in, so the grains don't come out.
* Drunk through the course of the night by adding more hot water, so all the alcohol is extracted.
* Prefers to ferment in warmer temperature, and it'll be easier to consume then. need to make sure the grains are well protected, as bugs and ants are likely to be attracted to the sugar that is generated by the mold from the millet grains.
* Is an excellent drink for colder weathers, cloudy dark times, but year around!
* Some experiments with spices possible too, but need to make sure the base recipe is perfected before moving into more complex situations.
* Made 5 different batches in Jan - Mar 2025, excited for the results.
