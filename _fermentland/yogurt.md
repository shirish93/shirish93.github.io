#### Introduction 

* thermophilic ferments, heat seeking ferment. 
* Need temmperatures around 50C, which is hot hot hot. Some exceptions abound.
* Yogurt, curd, differently, fermented milk in coagulated form,common in South Asian. 
* Heat milk until it's boiling, let it cool down until it's just a little too hot to touch, add existing yogurt starter, put it in high temperature for 8-16 hours. Lactose converted into other sugars, so no worries about lactose intolerance. 
* I put in the oven with the light turned on, overnight. Traditionally put in wooden buckets where the colonies of bacteria and yeast in the wood grains helped ferment, saw it in Nepal.
* Might have found other minor sources of 'innovation' to make the process less messy and possibly quicker. Less energy efficient.
* Eaten in smoothie, eaten with oatmeal, rice, as ingredient for baked goods, as a yogurt curry, can be used to make cheese, with rolled rice, highly respected in South Asia.
* The cultures found in the shops can't be used as a starter for more than 3-4 generations as they're not 'natural' ferments.
* Only a few perfect species are chosen for industrial purposes, they can be reused only so many times before they die out as they're not as hardy as natural variants.
* Natural starters available to buy, more expensive. Or other traditional cultures found to. Other examples: Dahi in South Asia, Skyr in Nordics. 
* Mostly similar transformation of milk into gel-like edible product, through different pathways and specific microbes.
* I produce too much yogurt for my consumption, love it much. 
* At one time producing 2 gallon yogurt a week for many months, for family, now significantly lesser. 
* Great with oat or with rice, but gets boring after a while, high in protein though.
* Can also be flavored, and if really really desired, added sugar and closed bottle can be used to make 'fizzy' yogurt, which is...a novel concept, might not be easily accepted.
