## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

The species of these two. What is chinese yeast balls? ?What is red rice yeast? What are they ysed for? The recipe is to basically used the starter culture into rice that is semi-cooked and let it ferment in protected environment for a couple of weeks. In the end you have a moldy ball of rice, that can then be added with more rice flour, and use to ferment other rice. For red rice yeast, it's something similar, except the output is purple rice, which then can be used to further ferment with the rice mold, thus making alcohol. THe alchohol thus produced is red in color naturally, and has anti-cholesterol properties, important to not use while consuming anti-choleterol drugs. Newa people of Kathmandu valley do the two-step process, difference between summer 'beer' and 'wine', health benefits, texture flavor and color. Excited to try it out, because never done mold fermentation with rice, like koji etc.
