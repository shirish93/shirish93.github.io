What are the species of these two. 
* What is chinese yeast balls? ?What is red rice yeast? 
* What are they ysed for? 
* The recipe is to basically used the starter culture into rice that is semi-cooked and let it ferment in protected environment for a couple of weeks.
* In the end you have a moldy ball of rice, that can then be added with more rice flour, and use to ferment other rice.
* For red rice yeast, it's something similar, except the output is purple rice, which then can be used to further ferment with the rice mold, thus making alcohol.
* THe alchohol thus produced is red in color naturally, and has anti-cholesterol properties, important to not use while consuming anti-choleterol drugs.
* Is quite a lot stronger than white rice yeast, and can behave very differently! Need to experiment before 'deploying'!
* Newa people of Kathmandu valley do the two-step process, difference between summer 'beer' and winter 'wine', health benefits, texture flavor and color. Excited to try it out, because never done mold fermentation with rice, like koji etc.
