## THIS IS A DRAFT. THE FERMENTATION BLOG IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WISH TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF FINNESSE

Alcoholic fermentation first began here. I learned to make invert sugars accidentally and saw they were extraordinarily potent.  Classic ferments: use a source of sugar, proteins, flavor, add yeast and nutrients, added extra sugar, let sit for many weeks to months, with a blowoff tube to let c02 out. Ccan last from a few weeks to many different months, can be multi-step depending on how you want to take it. Can survive in various temperatures, from mid-30s to 90's and 100's, though the temperature will decide what kind of brew it'll be so you need to plan ahead for the weather. I cooked the fruits /veggies first to help caramelize them and break the sugars down to make life easy for yeasts, added yeast and left them on the fermenter for months.
Outcome was extremely yeasty drink that smelt too strongly of booze and not much else. Realized consistent temperature is important, and need to make sure the flavor/smell components are not attacked by yeasts, alcohol. Need to let it mature to get the nasty heavier compounds out, which is why wines are aged. Not going to try again because they were worth too long time, took too much effort, didn't elicit a lot of excitement, and were always compared to standard bottled grape wine, which is always a tough comparison to beat.
