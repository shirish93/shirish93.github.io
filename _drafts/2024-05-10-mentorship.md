I have been a Hack.Diversity mentor for the past five years. I have mentored multiple engineering teams of Tufts grad students on their summer projects as a professional alumni. I have also been mentoring engineering leads at a non-profit, and an engineering consultancy that is based in Nepal. Additionally, I have helped out my friends' careers by helping them make lateral career moves and ask for promotions and raises. In that sense, I would say I have some experience mentoring people. In this essay, I will talk about how to become a good mentor and how to make the most of the mentor-mentee relationship for yourself and the person you are mentoring.

This is particularly relevant at this moment because my company has recently made mentoring a part of performance reviews. And so by becoming a better mentor you help the mentee, improve as a mentor and a leader, and also work towards your annual performance reviews. Let's get started.

**1. Ask them what they want.** Ask your mentee what they want out of the relationship. Maybe they want it to be strictly technical, and they want to improve their technical skills. Maybe they want help with their communication skills, maybe they want help with their leadership skills. Maybe they are interested in product management and development despite being engineers and want your guidance in that? Don't make any assumptions on what your mentee wants out of a relationship. Maybe they just want somebody to chat about nothing for 30 minutes or an hour every week or every two weeks. That's fine, too. That is what they want out of you and out of your relationship, and you should be there for them and provide it. That will be the extent of the relationship, if that's what they want.

**2. Play to your strengths.** All of us have our specialities, we are better in certain skills than others. That means we are more equipped to help our mentees in our fields of strength than the ones we are not as good at. So, your help will be most appreciated and you will get the most leverage out of your mentorship when you focus on areas of your greatest strength to help your mentee out. It doesn't have to always align with what they want either.

Here's an example. This year, I am mentoring a Hack.Diversity fellow. We have been doing intense technical and behavioral conversations and practices for their interview for entry-level engineering positions. I have been focusing my guidance mostly on software infrastructure stack because that's what I work on every day and that's where my relative strength lies.

Yes, it's true. Infrastructure questions are  not asked in software engineering interviews, particularly for entry-level positions. But, if your candidate impresses them in an interview with great knowledge and experience of having worked with software infrastructure, that is going to impress them, impress you for sure. And that's what I communicated to my fellow about. You are not going to be asked infrastructure questions, but you might be able to change the direction of the conversation towards your area of expertise. And that has benefited him greatly.

**3. Hold each other accountable.** A good mentor's job is to hold their mentee accountable for what they've set themselves to do. Ask your mentee to set up goals they hope to accomplish by your next meeting, noted down. And in the next meeting, ask them if they've accomplished those goals. If they were unable to do so, ask them what might have caused them not to meet their goals and provide assistance in helping them meet them. Once their goals are met, help them set further goals and help drive their journey by helping them be accountable.

On a similar note, set yourself some goals, possibly related to mentorship but other projects as well, and remind them to keep you accountable. I do that with my mentee from Hack.Diversity. I am working on a workshop for Hack.Diversity mentees to make them more capable engineers, help them improve their interviewing skills and networking skills. For that, I'm working on a lesson plan for each workshop session.

So, I've asked my mentee to remind me and check upon me on how far the syllabus development has gone. So, everythey were able to meet their push goals. If not, then you can always scale back the ambition. But having somebody push you to push yourself harder helps them motivate themselves. Do note that it's important to not be too pushy on setting more ambitious goals. As it can feel disheartening if they don't reach it and it can feel like it's coming from you instead of it being an act that's intended to help them empower themselves.

**4. Help them understand themselves and their goals clearer.** A good mentor should be able to help their mentee identify what they're looking for, not just in the mentor-mentee relationship, but in their professional lives in general. Depending on the parameters of your relationship, it can be a particular subfield of interest. If they want to have better leadership skills and want to use all your mentorship time for that cause, try to understand and try to help them understand themselves, what they're hoping to gain by gaining better leadership skills. Are they looking for a leadership position? Are they looking to lead other people without being in a leadership position? Are they looking to make change in the world and consider leadership a way of getting there? Are they looking to get into political positions? Are they looking to get into public office? Understanding the exact goal behind an activity will help clarify the steps needed to get there and make a personal growth plan that will get them there the quickest. You should be a part of that growth journey of theirs and help speed things up.

**5. Set a regular cadence in meetings, and avoid disrupting it.**

I hope these points help shape the dynamics of your mentor-mentee relationship significantly.
