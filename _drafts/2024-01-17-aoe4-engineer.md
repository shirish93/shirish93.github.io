Surprising lessons on how watching Age of Empires IV videogame online teaches important lessons applicable for software engineers.

### Introduction 

Competitive e-sports and software/infrastructure engineering might seem like disparate universes at first glance. I have however learned useful lessons from watching Age of Empired IV (AOE4) that I've been able to leverage into useful skills at work. This essay will explore how the skills honed through watching AOE4 esports have made me a better engineer, focusing on pressure-handling, planning, resource management, and adapting to change.

I have been watching the game ever since it released, following a few game 'casters', but mostly the players themselves on their recorded game casts on Youtube. It was initially just a way to entertain myself, like watching movies, but I've realized that I've internalized life skills applicable for a software engineer through those games.

The first and most striking parallel between AOE4 and infrastructure engineering lies in the ability to __manage multiple tasks simultaneously__. In any given AOE4 match, players find themselves juggling a multiple responsibilities: constructing buildings, managing resource production, training troops, scouting the enemy, and reacting to unexpected attacks. This mirrors the daily reality of an infrastructure engineer, who may be **juggling multiple projects, addressing service outages, and troubleshooting network issues, all while adhering to strict deadlines**.

Watching professional players solving these challenges is an educational experience. They are excellent in **prioritization and division of labor**, delegating tasks to villagers for resource gathering while simultaneously commanding their military to harass the opponent. They also need to have mastered the understanding of proper 'counters' to enemy units, tactically producing the correct units as a response to adversary production patterns. This allocation of resources translates directly to how I have to organize the multiple demands of my everyday job. By **prioritizing critical tasks, delegating effectively to the team, and maintaining a clear overview of ongoing projects**, I can get better the demands of their role.

AOE4 also requires players be excellent at **critical decision-making skills** under pressure. In the midst of a competitive match, players face rapid changes in the battlefield. It needs them to analyze situations quickly, make calculated decisions, and adapt their strategies on the fly. This translates directly to infrastructure engineering, where unforeseen technical issues can arise at any moment.

An engineer, for instance, might be overseeing a critical system upgrade when an unexpected network outage throws a wrench into the plan. Just as an AOE4 player must assess the situation, identify the cause of the disruption, and adjust their strategy accordingly, the engineer needs to **analyze the situation, identify the root cause of the outage, and devise a solution** to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth system upgrade. 

AOE4 tests a player's ability to **remain calm and focused** under pressure. High-stakes tournaments can be nerve-wracking, and maintaining composure in the face of potential defeat is important. Infrastructure engineers  work under tight deadlines and face the potential for significant consequences if mistakes occur. By learning from AOE4 players showing their ability to **stay calm under pressure and make sound decisions** in high-stress situations, an engineer can develop the resilience and composure needed to effectively work through the challenges of their profession.

Beyond individual decision-making, AOE4 also emphasizes the importance of **teamwork and communication** in achieving success. Professional AOE4 matches  involve team games, where players need to **coordinate their strategies, communicate effectively, and support each other** to overcome their opponents. This collaborative spirit directly translates to the **team-oriented environment of infrastructure engineering**. 

Just as AOE4 players rely on clear communication and coordinated efforts to achieve victory, an engineer relies on their team to successfully manage complex projects. Through their experience with AOE4 esports, the engineer has honed their **communication skills**, allowing them to **articulate complex technical concepts** to colleagues, **delegate tasks effectively**, and **build trust and cooperation** within their team. This, in turn, leads to a more efficient and productive work environment.

One of the most interesting aspects of AOE4 esports is the **emphasis on long-term planning**. The opening minutes of a match,  referred to as the **"early game,"** are vital for setting the stage for success later on. Skilled AOE4 players go to great efforts to strategize their **build order**, a sequence of actions that determines the initial construction of buildings and units. This foresight directly translates to the approach engineers take when tackling complex infrastructure projects.

Understanding the long-term implications of decisions is a basic skill in infrastructure engineering. When designing and implementing new systems, engineers go beyond addressing immediate needs and consider **potential future requirements and scalability**. This future-oriented mindset ensures the **resilience and adaptability** of the infrastructure they build in the face of changing needs.

For example, an engineer planning the upgrade of a company's services might not just focus on immediate capacity needs. By drawing inspiration from AOE4 players who plan their build orders with expansion in mind, the engineer might consider including **additional infrastructure capacity** to accommodate projected growth in the coming years. This proactive approach ensures thes service availability remains **functional and efficient** as the company's requirements evolve.

AOE4 players  **scout the map and analyze their opponent's strategies** early in the game. This **intelligence gathering** allows them to adapt their own plans and anticipate potential challenges. Similarly, engineers in thorough **planning and risk assessment** before taking on large-scale projects. This involves researching existing infrastructure, identifying potential roadblocks, and developing contingency plans to address any unforeseen issues. By proactively anticipating potential challenges, engineers can **minimize disruptions** and ensure the smooth execution of projects.

**Resource Management: Optimizing Allocation**

Similar to the demanding resource management in AOE4, engineers must work through a complex environment of **limited resources and diverse needs**. In a typical AOE4 game, players need to effectively manage multiple resources like food, wood, gold, and stone to construct buildings, train troops, and research technologies. This requires careful **allocation and balancing** to achieve their goals. An engineer, too, faces similar challenges. They must manage and allocate resources such as **budget, personnel, and time** across diverse projects, making sure resources are allocated by the order of priority.

By observing AOE4 players **prioritize resource gathering** and **optimize production chains** to maximize efficiency, an engineer can learn important lessons. For instance, the engineer might analyze the time and resources required for different project components and **prioritize tasks** accordingly. Alternatively, they might identify areas where **automation or resource pooling** can be implemented to streamline processes and optimize resource allocation.

Furthermore, AOE4 players  need to **adapt their resource management strategies** based on the **changing dynamics of the game**. For example, if they encounter an unexpected enemy attack, they might need to divert resources from building construction to focus on military production. Similarly, an engineer may encounter **unforeseen challenges** during a project that require **adapting resource allocation**. They might need to **reprioritize tasks, reallocate personnel, or seek additional resources** to address the situation effectively.

**Embracing Change and Innovation: The Constant Need to Adapt**

The Age of Empires community has to deal with the constantly shifting "meta" (most effective tactics), and we can find a surprisingly similar parallel to infrastructure engineering. In AOE4, failing to **stay updated with the latest strategies** can render even the most skilled player obsolete in a matter of weeks. This constant need for **adaptation and upskilling** is mirrored in the tech industry, where new technologies and best practices emerge at a rapid pace.

As an engineer, staying ahead of the curve requires **continuous learning and adaptation**. This involves actively seeking out new knowledge through training programs, conferences, and online resources. Just as AOE4 players analyze professional matches and adapt their strategies accordingly, the engineer closely follows industry trends and readily embraces new technologies to make sure they can **deliver efficient and future-proof solutions**.

Additionally, AOE4 shows the **spirit of innovation and calculated risk-taking**. Top players are not afraid to **experiment with new tactics** and surprise their opponents with **unorthodox approaches**. This translates to infrastructure engineering as well. Established solutions may not always be the most effective for every challenge. By **thinking outside the box** and **brainstorming creative solutions**, engineers can develop **innovative approaches** that address complex problems effectively. Watching AOE4 players show their **ingenuity** inspires the engineer to approach their work with a similar **open-mindedness and willingness to explore new possibilities**.

In conclusion, my experience with watching Age of Empires 4 as a spectator has gone beyond mere entertainment and unexpectedly enriched my professional career. The game's emphasis on **planning, resource management, teamwork, adaptation, and innovation** has inspired me to develop skills that I leverage daily in my work. From prioritizing tasks and allocating resources efficiently to remaining calm under pressure and adapting to unforeseen circumstances, the game has served as an unexpected training ground for the skills needed to gow as a software engineer.
