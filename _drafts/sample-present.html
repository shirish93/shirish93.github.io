                <h1>Getting ready to graduate</h1>
                <h3>Taking your product to the market</h3>
                <p>Shirish Pokharel</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is ‘graduation’ for a product?</li>
                    <li>When the initial design, prototyping, and testing phase is done</li>
                    <li>Taking it to customers to sell, validate, and get feedback</li>
                    <li>Even if not 100% ready, a demoable prototype is good enough</li>
                    <li>Marketing, and sales takes over from the development team</li>
                    <li>Great time to learn about your assumptions, and market situation!</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 2 -->
            <section>
                <h1>Why graduate</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>At some point you’ll run out of money developing the product!</li>
                    <li>Or the group funding you will run out of money and/or patience!</li>
                    <li>Because you’re ready to make real money!</li>
                    <li>If your product doesn’t make it to the market, you havelittle to show for your future endeavors</li>
                    <li>You’ll get a good sense of where your future direction should be headed</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 3 -->
            <section>
                <h1>Preparing mentally for graduation</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just like preparing for college graduation, mentally prepare that the world ‘out there’ is going to be harder</li>
                    <li>Understand that there’s going to be a lot of initial hurdles, but you have created a worthy product that the market deserves to get</li>
                    <li>You will need to put on your ‘sales and marketing’ hat on from now on, be prepared for the change in lifestyle</li>
                    <li>There will be a lot of competitors doing similar things, it’s good news! That means the market understands the value of your product</li>
                    <li>Start thinking from the perspective of the future customers, and what they want</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 4 -->
            <section>
                <h1>What’s next?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepare a list of all your strengths, and what’s great about your product</li>
                    <li>Think from the customer perspective, not engineering perspective: how will the customer be able to generate $$$ from your features?</li>
                    <li>Prepare a ’competitive advantage’ document: among all of of the competitors in the market, what’s so great about you? What’s your niche?</li>
                    <li>Prepare a technical brochure: a couple of pages (online, physical, any) listing your major features, and how awesome your product is!</li>
                    <li>Prepare a video/real-time demo of your product, using it as your customer would, and explain how the product is generating value</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 5 -->
            <section>
                <h1>Talking to the King</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use your industry leads to identify top 50 potential customers, start with a list of the 10 likeliest ones.</li>
                    <li>Call them and offer to run your demo for them, explaining what your business is</li>
                    <li>Practice the ”sales pitch” AKA what you are going to tell the customer in-person, a hundred times! It better be really good!</li>
                    <li>Meet the customer in person, give them the sales pitch, and follow up after a couple of days. Keep following up until they either buy, or reject you!</li>
                    <li>Even if they don’t want your product, ask if they know anybody who would get value from it, and follow up on them.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 6 -->
            <section>
                <h1>Immediate steps</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Come talk to me, schedule an appointment for your projects, and identify your strengths, and make future plans!</li>
                    <li>Get in the sales and marketing mindset! If your customer doesn’t hear about you, they won’t buy from you! If you give a bad sales pitch, they won’t know how good your product is!</li>
                    <li>Remember: you have to sell the product for yourself more than anything else. You’ve spent a lot of time and energy towards it, and you want the world to see it, feel it, appreciate it!</li>
                    <li>Make sure your product is visible in NIC Marketing and PR.</li>
